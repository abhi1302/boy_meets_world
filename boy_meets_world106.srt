00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:04,565
I have graded your book reports
from last Friday...

2
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:09,599
and after I pass them out,
we'll discuss them.

3
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:12,043
Ah, Mr. Matthews.

4
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:16,778
Shall I express
my usual disappointment...

5
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:19,843
or just ask you
to guide my sleigh tonight?

6
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:25,084
Uh, wrong holiday, Mr. Feeny.
See, Halloween's coming up...

7
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,787
and I was just test driving
my clown nose.

8
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:30,558
Then I insist
you stay in the driver's seat.

9
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,224
Put the nose back on...

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,692
for the rest of the morning.

11
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:39,205
Mr. Minkus,

excellent work as usual.

12
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,207
I particularly enjoyed
your haiku...

13
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:44,836
on Captain Ahab's obsession
with the great white whale.

14
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,346
"The calm blue ocean.

15
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,849
"Sun lights up
the monster's eye.

16
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:54,582
He sees me--whale food."

17
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,647
It works on so many levels.

18
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:01,388
-Brown-noser.
-Troglodyte.

19
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,396
Mr. Lewis, very good work.

20
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,093
Mr. Matthews,

not one of your better efforts.

21
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,193
Mr. Hunter.

22
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:13,002
Hey, this isn't fair.
Rick and I both got Cs.

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,701
How come you tell him
he did good work...

24
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,471
and you tell me it wasn't
one of my better efforts?

25
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:20,742
Would Bozo
please come to the center ring?

26
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:28,551
Mr. Lewis worked very hard
to get his C...

27
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,489
and I respect him for that.

28
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:32,890
You, on the other hand,

waste your efforts...

29
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,121
on being the class clown.

30
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,824
How come you always pick on me,
Mr. Feeny?

31
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,356
How come you never pick on
Minkus?

32
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,495
Have you taken a blow
to the head, Mr. Matthews?

33
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,563
Stuart Minkus
gets nothing but As.

34
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:50,008
If there was a letter
before "A," he would get that.

35
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,568
I guess that's why
he gets away with so much.

36
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,672
And just what
does he get away with?

37
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,979
Well, how come

when I make paper airplanes...

38
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:59,247
I get detention,
and he doesn't?

39
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,988
I Withdraw the question.

41
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,131
You waited for me?

42
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,295
Am I not your best friend?

43
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,860
You had detention, too,

didn't you?

44
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,237
oh, yeah. Mrs. Engles nailed me.

45
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:30,072
How'd you get detention in art?

46
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,374
Well, that's what makes me

one of the greats.

47
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,311
Hey.

48
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,750
Check this out,

answers to a test.

49
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,879
Shawn.

50
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:44,152
We can't be looking
at test answers.

51
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:48,628
That's major cheating,
detention for life.

52
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,562
No, these aren't

for a real test.

53
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:54,966
They're for that stupid lQ exam
we're taking tomorrow.

54
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:01,834
Wait a minute.
Let me take a look at this.

55
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,137
Wow.

56
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:06,339
The person who knows these
answers gets a perfect score.

57
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,177
on a test that doesn't even
count for a grade.

58
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,446
-Why bother?
-Are you kidding?

59
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,476
This is my one ticket
to get Feeny off my back.

60
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,511
If Feeny thinks I'm a genius...

61
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,023
he'll treat me just as good
as he treats Minkus.

62
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,151
Hey, Cory,
do yourself a favor.

63
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,889
Crumple the paper up,
throw it away in the trash.

64
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,396
Don't complicate your life.

65
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,400
You know,

that makes a lot of sense...

66
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:31,768
and if I was a smarter person,
I'd probably listen to you...

67
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,035
except I'm not
a smarter person...

68
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:38,101
But tomorrow,

I'm going to be a genius.

69
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:50,182
I have in my hands the results
of Tuesday's lQ test...

70
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:54,159
and one person here
deserves special mention.

71
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,684
This person achieved...

72
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,721
not only the highest score
in the class...

73
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,359
not only the highest score
in the school...

74
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:05,337
but a score so high as to
give rise to the question...

75
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:10,275
"ls there, in fact, a ceiling
on human intelligence?"

76
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,144
Please, Mr. Feeny,
you're embarrassing me.

77
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,445
Mr. Minkus, you came in second.

78
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,747
-Second?
-Uh-huh.

79
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:23,313
As in the context of not first?

80
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,689
Someone scored higher
than I did on the lQ test?

81
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,160
Blew you out
of the academic water.

82
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,299
Someone sitting
in this very classroom...

83
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,927
is a junior Kierkegaard.

84
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,938
-A what?
-A great mind, Mr. Matthews...

85
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,769
just like yours.

86
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:45,301
I have clearly underrated you,
and I bow to your genius.

87
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,374
Come on.

88
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,783
Bravo.

89
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,617
It's no big thing, Mr. Feeny.

90
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:59,682
on the contrary, Mr. Matthews,
it is a big thing.

91
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,160
It is a very big thing.

92
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,290
Uh-oh.

93
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,506

costume tomorrow, oK?

is buying Shelly Figus
her costume today.

96
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:26,611
Well, Shelly Figus must have
a better mom than you do.

97
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:30,555
Here's your chance
to try a little harder.

98
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,922
Hi, mom. Hi, weasel.

99
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,984
Eric, can you stay with Morgan
for an hour...

100
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,154
while I show a house?

101
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,131
Sure. You want to learn
how to be a big girl?

102
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,325
Yeah.

103
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,164
Because big girls know
how to take out the garbage...

104
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,363
so their brothers don't have to.

105
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,396
Really? You'd teach me
how to take out the garbage?

106
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,534
-Yep.
-What am l, an idiot?

107
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,336
I want my Halloween costume.

108
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,076
It's no big deal, mom.
I'll help her pick one out.

109
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,242
oh, would you?

110
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,478
Yeah. If you could just
drop us off at the store...

111
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,748
I'll have dad pick us up
on his way home from work.

112

lot of homework. Got to go.

118
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:16,496
Yeah. What he said.

119
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,834
-Something terrible?
-oh, yeah.

120
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,499
Absolutely.

121
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:24,702
Feeny knows.

122
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,178
Somehow he knows,

and he's going to get me.

123
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,339
You're wrong.

124
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,849
You think he's just sending
a thank you note to my parents?

125
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,682
"Thank you for bringing up
your son. He's a genius.

126
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,848
He's smarter than
Captain Kirkaguard."

127
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:40,952
What are you doing?

128
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,656
That's a sealed envelope
addressed to my parents.

Now they're going to know
I opened it.

130
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,631
Corey, do your parents
ever write letters to anyone?

131
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,067
Yeah.

132
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,367
And when they do,
what do they put the letters in?

133
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,100
Envelopes.

134
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,576
Just like this one.

135
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,078
So we could read the note.

136
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,105
And seal it back up
in a new white envelope.

137
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,585

-The State Education Authority.

Not if I'm making all this up.

145
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,700
-Are you?
-No.

146
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,231
I'm cooked!

147
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,505
Relax.
of course I'm making it up.

148
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:34,012
He just wants to talk
to your parents.

149
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,413
What if he tells them
he doesn't think I'm a genius?

150
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,110
Who cares if Feeny
doesn't think you're brilliant?

151
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,312
As long as the test says so.

152
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,254
But I'm not,

and my parents know I'm not.

153
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,257
Then you'll have to make them
think you are.

154
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,488
-How do I do that?
-Get with the program, Cory.

160
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:35,969
is that classical music
you're listening to?

161

oh, that was just a commercial
during the baseball game.

-oh, selling cellos, were they?
-Yeah, I guess so.

conducting that symphony...

with your Phillies finger.

165
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,554
It wasn't a symphony, dad.

Piano Concerto in "E" Flat.

talking to Mr. Feeny.

We know about the lQ test.

-You do?
-We do.

I Wouldn't think of it.

175
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,640
Cory, your father and l
are having a little trouble...

176
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:17,206
understanding why your
lQ test scores are up here...

177
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,243
and your report cards
are, well, down here.

178
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,620
You know, I've been giving that
some thought, too, mom.

179
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,955
I've decided that
what you're seeing...

180
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:31,361
is the flaw
in our public education system.

181
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,332
Yeah, I'm seeing the flaw.

182
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,834
Because the way I see it...

183
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:38,702
I didn't fail the system,
the system failed me.

184
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,000
That's the way you see it?

185
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,166
What other explanation
could there be, dad?

186
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,870
-Mommy!
-Up here, angel face.

187
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,173
I don't know, Cor...

188
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,305
It's just seems that after
1 5 years of being a mother...

189
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,646
I'd like to think
I know my own children.

190
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,288
I'm a zombie.

191
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,314
Is my little sister hideous
or what?

192
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:02,692
-Hi, Eric.

-Very gruesome.

193
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:03,889
Blackout teeth?

194
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,893
ooh. That's my little girl.

195
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,094
There were no
Cinderella costumes?

196
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,261
Hundreds of them.

197
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,237
And you had to choose
axe in the head here?

198
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,705
It Was the last one.

199
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,298
ooh, nice hanging eyeball.

200
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,538
I wanted Morgan
to choose her own costume.

201
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,409
She did choose it, mom.

She wanted to be a zombie.

202
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,574
Eric, 24 hours ago, she didn't
know what a zombie was.

203
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,881
The undead are cool.

204
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:34,849
Shawn, this whole thing
is getting out of hand.

205
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,623
Relax. Everybody thinks
you're brilliant.

206
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:37,789
You should enjoy it.

207
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,855
When it was just Feeny,
I could enjoy it.

208
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,697
But now my parents are involved,
and I don't like lying to them.

209
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,168
-You don't?
-No.

210
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,672
'Cause it gives me
a little rush.

211
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,335
Besides, you didn't tell them
you were a genius, Feeny did.

212
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,867
And I didn't tell Feeny
I'm a genius.

213
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:56,279
The test did. And you didn't
ask to take the test.

214
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,715
They gave it to me.

215
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,581
And you wouldn't have
even seen the answers...

216
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,587
-lf they didn't give us...
-Detention.

217
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,088
We're innocent victims.

218
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,987
Nothing we do
is actually our fault.

219
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,822
It's good to be kids.

220
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,954
-I don't get it.
-What?

221
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,328
If you're smarter than I am...

222
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:15,698
how come you're always
trying to copy from my paper?

223
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,965
-Uh...
-He's not copying, Minkus.

224
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,562
He's just glancing over
to admire...

225
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:20,732
the work of a fellow genius.

226
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:21,899
-You are?
-He is.

227
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,704
I am.

228
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,906
oh, well, that's oK.

In fact, from now on...

229
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,607
I'll kind of tip
my test papers up...

230
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,878
so you can admire the answers
even easier.

231
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,215
-Would you do that?
-No.

232
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,919
Genius envy.

233
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,221
[Bell rings]

234
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,227
Class, this is Miss Chin.

235
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,126
She'll be with you
for the first half hour...

236
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,392
while I have a word
with Mr. Matthews.

237
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:52,494
Tell my mom
I went out like a man.

238
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,899
Mr. Matthews,

I brought you down here...

239
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:02,347
in case there was anything
you cared to say to me.

240
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,407
Uh, about what, Mr. Feeny?

241
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,977
oh, I don't know.

Sports, the weather...

242
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:11,513
the inevitable ramifications
of deception.

243
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:15,186
-I choose sports.
-Too bad.

244
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:16,354
How come?

245
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,956
Your new school
doesn't have any.

246
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,827
You know, for a minute there...

247
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:26,430
I thought you said new school.
Ha ha ha!

248
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,167
I did.

249
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,767
one that offers
an entire curriculum...

250
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,177
geared toward students
like yourself.

251
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,680
No mindless distractions...

252
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:39,207
such as baseball, football,

basketball.

253
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:42,415
Wait a minute.
What do they do for fun?

254
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:43,649
They study.

255
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,649
-What do they do for exercise?
-They study till they sweat.

256
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,225
No sports teams at all?

257
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:54,392
Well, they have
a highly spirited chess team.

258
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,301
Chess?

259
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,805
You know, Mr. Feeny,
I'm thinking...

260
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,739
as fun as that sounds...

261
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,366
I feel like the smart kids
at that school...

262
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,535
don't really need me.

263
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,568
You and my friends here need me.

264
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,671
oh, but

we'd be holding you back.

265
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:11,684
No. You wouldn't. Um, I could

help you teach a class.

266
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,686
You and l, we'd be like a team.

267
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,688
Two men with l.Q.s
working together...

268
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,282
for the good
of all these deserving kids.

269
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:22,784
No, I think we'll just have
to muddle through without you.

270
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,730
The school district
is committed...

271
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:28,598
to giving gifted children
everything they deserve...

272
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:32,866
and I think you deserve
everything you're going to get.

273
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,964
I don't really think
I deserve anything.

274
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,634
oh, but according to the test,
you do.

275
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,906
Mr. Feeny,
I'm smart enough to know...

276
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,913
you don't really think
I'm a genius.

277
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,677
Mr. Matthews, it no longer
matters what I think.

278
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,412
What matters is
you're no longer in my class.

279
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:54,057
Don't you love Halloween?
No one is what they seem to be.

280
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,797
oK, I'm here.

What's the big emergency?

281
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:08,399
Hey! What are you
trying to do, kill me?

282
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,602
Kill you?
I'll tell you about killed.

283
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,510
-How about what you did to me?
-What'd I do?

284
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,514
Where are you spending
your next recess?

285
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,345
Playground, shooting hoops,
playing ball?

286
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,611
So?

287
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,618
So let me tell you
what I'm doing.

288
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:23,144
I'm searching for Bobby Fischer!

289
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,121
What are you talking about?

290
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,127
Geniuses go to a special school.

291
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,629
Did you know that?
You killed me.

292
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,631
I'm going to be in a class
full of Minkuses.

293
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,530
Wait a minute.
What am I talking about?

294
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,536
These kids make Minkus
look like Fabio.

295
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,765
Wait a minute. They're
putting you in another school?

296
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,832
Yes. The lady is going
to be here in a half an hour...

297
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,570
and they're going to give me
another genius test...

298
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,168
and then
they're going to take me away.

299
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,839
So I just called you up
to say good-bye.

300
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,474
or as geniuses say,
good-bye in Latin.

301
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:54,282
-Hey, idiot.
-What?

302
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,686
-Are you a genius?
-No.

303
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,519
Do you have the answers
to this test?

304
00:15:58,558 --> 00:15:59,718
No.

305
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,659
You kind of see
where I'm going with this?

306
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,753
You want me to throw the test?

307
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,264
oh, no, no.

I want you to take the test...

308
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,630
to the best of your ability.

309
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,964
And no guessing.

310
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,834
I wouldn't want you
to stumble onto a right answer.

311
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:24,079
So, Mrs. Matthews,

you're a housewife?

312
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,583
Uh, Amy's a homemaker.

313
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:28,086
She wrangles three kids,
runs this house...

314
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,987
and still manages to sell
real estate quite successfully.

315
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:35,221
And I understand
you work in a grocery store.

316
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,626
Well, Alan is the manager...

317
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,926
of the largest supermarket
in this whole area.

318
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:45,336
Ah. Tradesmen are so important
and yet so little respected.

319
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:50,267
Mommy? Can I have cookies?

320
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,038
No, honey.
It's too close to dinner.

321
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,241
You realize, don't you,
that her clothes don't match?

322
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,078
We let her pick out
her own clothes.

323
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:00,210
We feel it encourages
Morgan's creativity.

324
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,721
Indeed.
Well, if yours are the genes...

325
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,417
that have produced
our darling Cory...

326
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,153
then perhaps
you've done it again...

327
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,660
with young Morgan here.

328
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,857
Shall we try
a word-association problem?

329
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:15,299
-oK.
-Maple is to elm...

330
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,030
as daisy is to...

331
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,628
Booger?

332
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,332
You may go.

333
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,145
Change your clothes.

334
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:31,138
Genetics is so hit or miss.

335
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,844
All done.

336
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,944
Why, Cory, most students need...

337
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,080
at least a full hour
for this test.

338
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,421
I'll just get out
the answer template.

339
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,483
And that should confirm...

340
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,552
What we already know.

341
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,865
Hmm...

342
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,027
-Hmm...
-Hmm...

343
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:55,039
Well, Cory, if I'm to believe
the results of this test...

344
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,439
then your l.Q. would be...

345
00:17:56,475 --> 00:18:00,309
about that
of an average sixth grader.

346
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:05,409
Yup, that's me. The lights
are on, but nobody's home.

347
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:09,285
Did you really think
you'd get away with it, Cory?

348
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:12,382
No, I guess I knew I'd be
caught from the beginning.

349
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,154
I guess we knew that, too.

350
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,286
-Cory cheated.
-I'm not a genius.

351
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,729
You'd like us to believe that,

wouldn't you, Cory?

352
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,288
-Huh?
-Huh?

353
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:24,667
Your son is manifesting typical
behavior for a young genius.

354
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:28,037
But I'm not smart.
Look at your answer sheet.

355
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:30,201
It says I'm a moron.
I know it does.

356
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,971
He doesn't want
to leave his old school...

357
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,137
and all his friends.

358
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,704
That is why you cheated
on this test, isn't it, Cory?

359
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,114
Yes. Well, no, but--

360
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,779
Look, when I said I cheated,

I didn't mean this test.

361
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,083
I meant the first test...

362
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,716
the one Feeny gave us
that said I was a genius.

363
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:48,226
-Cory...
-No. Please. Don't talk.

364
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,228
Every time you talk,
you make me sound smart.

365
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,798
Look, mom, dad...

366
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,859
I found the answers to
Feeny's test and memorized them.

367
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,301
I'm not a genius.

368
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,703
We kind of figured that.

369
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,230
You did?

370
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:06,233
Yeah, but we're glad you
finally decided to come clean.

371
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:10,112
You'll excuse me, but there are

actual prodigies out there...

372
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,980
who deserve
my attention and respect.

373
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,987
I can't waste my time
with normal people like you.

374
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:17,489
Well, you'll excuse me,
but normal people like us...

375
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,583
have raised our children
to be normal kids.

376
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,991
I'm sorry if they don't fit...

377
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,929
some arbitrary
intellectual standard of yours.

378
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,090
But we're not sorry...

379
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,396
that they're well brought up
and completely normal.

380
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:33,428
Aah!

381
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,599
Is this better?

382
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,610
She's a zombie.
You got a problem with that?

383
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,370
You must be so proud.

384
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:49,078
Hmm. You guys knew I wasn't
a genius all along, didn't you?

385
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,351
Yeah, I guess we did.

386
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,221
How come
you went along with me?

387
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:56,228
Well, Cory, we would never
accuse you of cheating.

388
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,628
We had no proof that you did.

389
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,892
We just hoped
you were smart enough...

390
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,457
to tell us the truth eventually.

391
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,900
I wasn't even smart enough
to do that...

392
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,995
until
I was backed into a corner.

393
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,972
I guess I blew it, huh?

394
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,702
-Yep.
-Grounded?

395
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,573
Yep. Two weeks.

396
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,202
I'll be in my room.

397
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:16,510
Yes, you will be, starting
the day after Halloween.

398
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,676
You mean
I can still have Halloween?

399
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,185
As long as
you don't go disguised...

400
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,187
as a boy who cheats on tests.

401
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,519
I won't. That costume
was totally wrong for me.

402
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,355
Cory, you don't have to ever
try to be something you're not.

403
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,226
So from now on, I'll just wear
my normal-kid outfit.

404
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,253
It always looked good on you.

405
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,000
[Bell rings]

406
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:40,529
Please read chapter seven and
be ready to discuss it tomorrow.

407
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:48,942
Bozo resigns.
I'm turning in my nose.

408
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,176
I figure as long
as I'm going to give up...

409
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:52,343
being the class genius...

410
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,375
I'll give up
being the class clown, too.

411
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,912
Fair trade. Welcome back
to class, Mr. Matthews.

412
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,289
I guess I thought
a guy had to be a genius...

413
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:01,691
to earn your respect.

414
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,991
All my students have to do
to earn my respect...

415
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,587
is try their hardest.

416
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,099
I guess that's why
you didn't bust Rick Lewis...

417
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,601
for failing
this week's math quiz.

418
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,398
That's right.
He did the best he could.

419
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,200
He just didn't understand
the material.

420
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:17,266
I consider the failure mine,

and I will try my hardest...

421
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,334
to make sure
Mr. Lewis understands...

422
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,107
the next assignment.

423
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:24,639
Well, I think that's

really cool of you, Mr. Feeny.

424
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,149
I'm cool.

425
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,522
God, help me.

426
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:39,961
[Doorbell chimes]

427
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,559
My turn, my turn!

428
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,201
Trick or treat!

429
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,872
one for you, one for you,
two for me.

430
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:59,445
Hey, look. There's the guy
that's handing out the rulers.

431
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,753
You're too big
to trick or treat.

432
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:07,418
Yes, well, apparently my treats
aren't going over so well.

433
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,984
Uh, would you ask
one of your parents...

434
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,394
if I could borrow some candy?

435
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,456
Mom! Dad!

436
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,167
Trick or treat!

437
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:18,966
The candy's on its way.

438
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,472
Hey, aren't you
that Feeny guy from school?

439
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,065
I'm Mr. Feeny, yes.

440
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,632
My brother's friend
Cory Matthews...

441
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,145
said I'm going to have you
for a teacher next year.

442
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,943
He said you're the best teacher
in the whole school.

443
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:34,442
oh, please, Mr. Matthews.
I wasn't born yesterda--

444
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,011
I'm terribly sorry.

445
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,092
Happy Halloween.

446
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,855
Here, have a ruler.

447
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:45,329
Have all the rulers.

448
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,922
-George.
-Yes?

449
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,433
There's plenty of candy
here in the kitchen.

450
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,697
Thank you.

451
