invested our imaginary $1,000...

00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,573
in the stock market.

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:13,410
-And how did you do?
-We kicked Wall Street butt.

4
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:15,347
Yet, none of the companies
we invested in...

5
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:19,375
discriminate on the basis
of race, sex, or bad karma.

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,221
You got to love her.

7
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:28,660
You got to lock her up.

8
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,663
Well thought out, Mr. Minkus.

9
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,665
Very politically correct,
Miss Lawrence.

10
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,223
Which company's next?

11
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:37,396
Mr. Feeny, this project
wasn't due for another week.

12
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,905
This is just a progress report,
Mr. Matthews.

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,376
Those companies Who've made
progress should have no problem.

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,072
Ahem. We have a problem.

15
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,551
our investment plan is...

16
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,053
proceeding.

17
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:57,056
We are pleased to report
we have absolutely no losses.

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,617
And we haven't fired anybody,
and nobody quit.

19
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,652
They haven't even started yet.

20
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,831
No?

[Bell rings]

22
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,500
Come here.

23
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,371
In the week that you have left
with this assignment...

24
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,507
I Want to see some real effort.

25
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,848
Mr. Feeny,
"effort" is my middle name.

26
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:27,786
'Cause it starts with "F '."

27
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,225
I'm glad our company
is making money...

28
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,421
because as the future mother
of my children...

29
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,431
you are going to live
in the lap of luxury...

30
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,628
because I am a provider, babe.

31
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,694
Minkus, anyone can
draw lines on a chart...

32
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,400
and say they're making money.

33
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,635
You know,

you guys are big talk...

34
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,869
because you're bigger than me...

35
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,377
but when it comes
to using your brains...

36
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,844
how confident are you?

37
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,143
More confidenter than you.

38
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,385
Let me handle the negotiations,
Mongo.

39
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,717
What have you got in mind?

40
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,155
I say we forget
Feeny's imaginary money...

41
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:07,183
and we invest real money
and see who comes out on top.

42
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,252
I don't have a real $1,000.

43
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,763
You get an allowance, don't you?

44
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,129
That five bucks is sacred.
That's my snack money.

-No.

-Fifteen.

in this.

Fine. Let me set it up for you.

54
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:32,181

in a battle of wits.

$300,000.

56
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,179

every minute.

I'm just going to give this
to Minkus now...

60
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,332
so I don't get attached to it.

69
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,491
If your uncle knows how
to make money this easy...

72
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,489
We bet our whole week's
allowance on a horse.

My lungs can't take it.

calls my mom...

no one's listening.

All right.
Your name is Brianna Henshaw.

You're the best-looking girl
in school.

accidentally stumble
into your best friend Debbie...

and inadvertently
French-kiss her.

Why won't you go out with me?

Hey, Eric,
you like this girl...

139
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,986
well, then,

you got to take a big risk.

140
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,659
-I know about this.
-oh, you do?

141
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,329
Well, I'm always eager to get
romantic advice from a fetus.

142
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,463
The point is, you're never
going to win her over...

143
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,942
unless you do something bold,
unless you take a risk.

That's how I live my life.
I'm Risk Boy.

145
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,347
After careful market analysis...

146
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,854
product testing,
and strategic planning...

147
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,858
we bet on Tuna Melt to win.

148
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,190
You gambled with your $10?

149
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,958
-It's $1,000.
-oh, right, right.

150
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,364
You invested your money
on a racehorse?

151
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,628
And we won.

Call the police, Mr. Feeny.
It's illegal for minors to bet.

Well, now,

he has a point, Mr. Matthews.

154
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,774
Yes, he does.

Good point, little nerdling.

155
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,335
Except in this assignment...

156
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,439
we're supposed to be
businessmen and businesswomen.

157
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,676
And as we all know...

158
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:06,982
it's perfectly legal for men
and women to play the ponies.

159
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,320
Mm-hmm. Although I don't
condone gambling in any form...

160
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,826
Mr. Matthews and Hunter
have demonstrated...

161
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,318
a basic tenet
of American free enterprise--

162
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:20,731
the bigger the risk,
the bigger the reward.

163
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,964
-Risk, risk, risk.

-Reward, reward, reward.

than this.

I am a dating god. Worship me.

170
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,690
Ignore him. Maybe his big head
will float him upstairs.

171
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,295
I was bold, I took a risk...

172
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:01,637
and now I got a date
with Brianna Henshaw.

173
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,973
And you should be saying
thank you to whom?

174
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:08,640
The Helco Locker Company

349
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,668
What restaurant
did you go to anyway?

350
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,762
Can't we just
forget about this...

351
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,740
just get on to the romantic
part of the evening?

352
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:56,935
Mm-hmm.

353
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,970
Just tell me. Where did you go?

354
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,243
I Went to Phil's Grill.

355
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:07,116
Phil's grill? That's--oh.

356
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,644
What? "oh"?

357
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,156
Come on. Let's go inside.

358
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,657
No, wait a minute,

wait a minute.

359
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:15,354
That was a big mistake. "oh."

360
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,952
Can't we just get on...

361
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:19,624
with the romantic part
of the evening, Pooh-bear?

362
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,634
No, wait a minute. No, no, no.

Don't you Pooh-bear me.

363
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:26,434
I did propose to you
at Phil's Grill, didn't l?

364
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:31,000
-Yes, you did.
-ooh, I knew it! I knew it.

365
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,772
What happened at Chez Lafleur?

366
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,781
I was proposed to
at Chez Lafleur.

367
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,046
Not by me.

368
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:40,575
Are you hungry? I'm so hungry.

369
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,746
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

370
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,914
Who proposed to you
at Chez Lafleur?

371
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,323
-Mark BraithWaite.
-Mark BraithWaite?

372
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,385
Mark BraithWaite
proposed to you?

373
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,191
Who is Mark Braithwaite?

374
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,028
-Some guy.
-Some guy?

375
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,296
Some random drive-by proposal?

376
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,304
Somebody proposed to you,
and you didn't tell me about it?

377
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,203
-No.
-Why not?

378
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,141
oh, 'cause silly me, I thought
maybe you'd get angry.

379
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:08,135
oh, well, fine. obviously
you know me. I don't know you.

380
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,670
Alan!

381
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,683
Did you accept the proposal?

382
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,686
Do you have another set
of children in Muncie, lndiana?

383
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,187
Are Vera, Chuck, and Dave...

384
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,087
waiting for their mother
to come back...

385
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:21,093
after stepping out for gum
eighteen years ago?

386
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:25,530
"So the velveteen rabbit said,

'l am a real rabbit."'

387
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:29,864
-Alan.
-Amy, if that's your real name.

388
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,632
Cory, what happened?

389
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,641
It's all my fault. No one else
is to blame except me.

390
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,835
But don't worry, dad.

391
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,275
I'm going to pay for it
out of my own money.

392
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,177
Your own money?
How are you going to do that?

393
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,680
Well, I would tell you...

394
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,444
but the yelling and screaming
that would happen...

395
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,644
would only wake up
my dear little sister...

396
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,086
who, thank God, is still alive.

397
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,559
Well, based on

performance figures to date...

398
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,185
it seems as though...

399
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,822
the Matthews-Hunter
Consortium...

400
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,560
is our most profitable
corporation.

401
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,865
So, gentlemen, do you have
any business tips...

402
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,236
for our other
young entrepreneurs?

403
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:10,731
Yeah.
Some people bet on a jockey.

404
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:14,678
I say, "Give me a horse
that can run in the mud."

405
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,375
oh, bravo.

406
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,882
Anything to add, Mr. Matthews?

407
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,389
Yes. The greater the risk...

408
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,890
the greater
the potential profit.

409
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,325
Just like you taught us,
Mr. Feeny.

410
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,828
Yes, but sometimes

the glitter of the profit...

411
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:33,627
makes one lose sight
of the risk.

412
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,134
And you should never
gamble anything...

413
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,193
that you can't afford to lose.

414
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,536
-I didn't teach you that.
-No, you didn't.

415
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:45,340
I kind of managed
to trip over that one myself.

416
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,346
[Bell rings]

417
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:57,084
You know, Stu, I was so busy
counting money yesterday...

418
00:20:57,123 --> 00:21:00,320
I completely forgot
to give you your valentine.

419
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,623
So...here.

420
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,186
No hard feelings, eh, big brain?

421
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,333
Should I open it?

422
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,858
I know it's just going
to be insulting and mean.

423
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:13,667
Sticks and stones
may break your bones...

424
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,765
but words can never hurt you.

425
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:18,907
I made that up.

426
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,315
Mm-hmm.

427
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:29,947
-"Happy Valentine's Day."
-Ah.

428
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,479
"Turn around."

429
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:54,437
Here, mom.

430
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,777
What's this?

431
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,079
It's all the money
Shawn and I had left over...

432
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:00,551
after we paid
for the vase and the door.

433
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,110
And you spent it on me?

434
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,418
Easy come, easy go.

435
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,760
Is that from Mark BraithWaite?

436
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,461
No. It's from Cory Matthews.

437
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:20,131
Well, in case it gets lonely.

438
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:26,108
Pooh-bear, they're beautiful.
Why?

439
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:30,605
Because this was the worst
Valentine's Day of my life.

440
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,617
Including the time
that Margie Dwyer...

441
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,881
told all the girls
in fifth grade I had cooties...

442
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,512
and they threw my cards away.

443
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,614
oh.

444
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,124
And I was thinking...

445
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,684
that you may have been
proposed to twice...

446
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,663
but you only said yes once...

447
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,792
and I'm glad it was me.

448
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,927
Happy Valentine's Day,
Boom-Boom.

449
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,938
So...

450
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:02,109
What makes you think
I was only proposed to twiceിഊ㤊㤹ഹ《㨰〰〺㔬〰ⴠ㸭〠㨰〰㈺〬ര㰊潦瑮挠汯牯∽昣晦て∰猠穩㵥㐱眾睷琮獶扵楴汴獥渮瑥⼼潦瑮ാ
