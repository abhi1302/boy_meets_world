3

cutting off oxygen
and disrupting the ecosystem.

4
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:12,904
So, what we've learned...

5
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:15,506
is that we must choose
biodegradable products...

6
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,244
to help protect our environment.

7
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,952
Excellent report.

17
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:55,915
Well researched.

18
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:58,948

clean crisp mountain air.

19
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:03,759
Philadelphia--
polluted industrial smog.

home of the Colorado Rockies.

21
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:11,337
Veterans Stadium--home of
the Philadelphia Phillies.

22
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,566
oh, here we go.

23
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:16,838
The Rockies, a bogus
expansion team mind you...

24
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,572
are averaging
four more runs per game...

25
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,079
than anyone in the league...

26
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,172
because of their clean air.

27
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,206
our theory
is if Philadelphia...

28
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,048
would clean up its smoggy air...

29
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,815
the ball would slice through
the atmosphere...

30
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,321
with a greater velocity.

31
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,517
Therefore the Phillies
would score more runs.

32
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,823
And win every home game.
The end.

33
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,795

I'll choose the teams.

you'll work with Mr. Minkus.

44
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,025
And Mr. Matthews--

45
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,586
Yeah, I'll hook up
with Mr. Sullivan.

46
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,758
No, no. That's worse.

of the beholder, Mr. Matthews.

I, for example...

that question.

Well, would this

qualify as a Brillo head?

72
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:50,118
Nah. You're more like
a Nerf head.

73
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:53,058

and you didn't tell me?

Well, like

a lot of normal people...

86
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,515
I refer to him as "Dad."

87
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:28,460
Then how do you tell him apart
from all the other dads?

88
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,924
Look, Topanga, is there any way
we can do this assignment...

89
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,594
on the phone or by telepathy?

90
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,468
It concerns our environment.

91
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,133
I think it deserves
more direct attention.

92
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,404

my house after school.

93

Before I leave...

94
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:48,779
I'd like you to sign a petition
to save Mrs. Rosemead's job.

95
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,715
Who's Mrs. Rosemead?

96
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,615
our librarian.

97
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,620
They're forcing her to retire.

98
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,519
It's blatant ageism.

99
00:05:56,556 --> 00:06:00,083
Maybe because
she's blatantly old.

100
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,287
Look, can we talk about

this later?

101
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,796
We're real, real busy here.

102
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,526

hate your guts.

104

105

At least
he didn't give me Minkus.

106

Hey, Minkus doesn't like me...

107
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,777
he doesn't trust me,

and he doesn't respect me.

108
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,284
So he's doing
the whole assignment by himself.

109
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:28,515
In my book,
Stuart Minkus is a god.

going to do about my hair?

to straighten her hair.

00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,338
Your sister
straightens her hair?

118
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:59,341
Yeah. If she didn't,

it'd look as bad as...

119
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,877

No, honey.
That would be a mistake.

than my friends laughing.

180
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,302
People make fun of you, Topanga.

181
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,241
So?

182
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,439
I couldn't take it.
I just want to blend in.

183
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,948
Well, you're sure good at it.

184
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,780
You look like all
the other plain-wrapped kids...

185
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,343
at school...
except for your red hat.

186
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,355
Hey, I got that on Cap Night.

187
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,550
I had to Wait an hour in line.

188
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:31,125
Well, if

it's important to you...

189
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,927
then it's beautiful.

190
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,158
Got the stuff.

191
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:41,997
Use a mirror, babe.

192
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,609
What stuff?

193
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,116
Let me ask you something.

194
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,711
What do you think of my hair?
You think it looks good?

195
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:57,484
It's beautiful,

like a desert tumbleweed.

196
00:10:57,524 --> 00:11:00,550
oK. Thank you
for those thoughts.

197
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,424
Look, Topanga,
you want to do...

198
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,123
this performance thing,
you go for it.

199
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,529
I'll see you tomorrow.

200
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,192
Are we all done for today?

201
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,098
Yeah. Shawn and l
have another project...

202
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,534
we're working on now.

203
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,800
Really? What is it?

204
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,206
Well, you know
how those dolphins...

205
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,539
get caught in the tuna nets?

206
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:18,874
Yeah.

207
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,903
It's got
nothing to do with that.

208
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,789
So, should this stuff

be burning?

209
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,053
Why, is it burning?

210
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,720
No. I'm just trying
to make conversation...

211
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,730
because we never really
get to talk.

212
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,629
-How bad's it burning?
-Call your sister.

213
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:44,069
Ask her if my ears should feel
like throbbing jalapenos.

214
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,570
Hi, Stacey. It's me.

215
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,970
Listen, Cory wants to know
if that stuff...

216
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,564
you sent over
should be burning.

217
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,633
Uh-huh. Really?

218
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,542
Hurting! Hurting now!

219
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:53,739
Stacey wants to know
how long it's been burning?

220
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,305
-40, 45 minutes.

-45 minutes.

221
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:57,680
Shawn,

I'm going to rip my head off!

222
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,981
Stacey says you should've
washed it out 45 minutes ago.

223
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,111
Aah!

224
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,622
Stacey says you shouldn't
have left it in so long.

225
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,625
Stacey says why didn't
you two idiots read the label?

226
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,991
oh, thanks, Stace.

227
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:12,156
CoRY: Aah!

228
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:16,567
Aah!

229
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,935
Aah!
[Electronic beeping]

230
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,733
[Gasps]

231
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,935
BOTH: Aaah!

232
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,845
SHAWN: I had
nothing to do with this.

233
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,441
Cory, what did you do
to your beautiful hair?

234
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:35,011
It Wasn't beautiful.
It looked like Velcro.

235
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:38,615
Nothing's going
to stick to that now, man.

236
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,489
This is your fault.
You got the good hair.

237
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,687
Yeah, I did, didn't l?

238
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,389
oK. We can fix this.

239
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,765
Just...not with a comb.

240
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,327
Doesn't really matter, Mom.
His hair's gonna fall out.

241
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:53,703
Eric, stop it.

242
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,037
What? I'm just saying.

243
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,336
Kid at school
tried the same thing.

244
00:12:56,376 --> 00:13:00,073
Bald as cue ball.
She looks terrible.

245
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,013
I don't like my new dolly.

246
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,016
She's not wearing
a pretty dress.

247
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,018
Well, honey,
she's a businesswoman.

248
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:08,020
I mean, this dolly
has gone to college...

249
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,351
has a good job...

250
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:12,552
and doesn't need Ken
to support her.

251
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:16,050
Who cares?
I got a head problem here.

252
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,586
Hey, it's Punky Brewster!

253
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,135
That's a hat, right?

254
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,468
Yeah.
Try and take it off.

255
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,407
Cory, what did you do?

256
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,508
I tried to straighten
my hair, oK?

257
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,384
With what, shellac?

258
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,719
Dad, you think
a little shampoo might--

259
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,224
No. You see, the whole

principle behind shampoo...

260
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,817
is that it actually has
to touch your hair.

261
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,350
It's completely ineffective
if there's...

262
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,920
a polyurethane force field
surrounding your head.

263
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,228
I just hope
your hair doesn't fall out.

264
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:55,427
Alan!

265
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:56,628
oh, honey,
a guy at work, Mike...

266
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,829
put this kind of stuff
in his hair.

267
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,030
Bald as a cue ball.

268
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,302
oK. Listen up, family...

269
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,673
because I admit I didn't
know what I was doing...

270
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,007
when I put this stuff
on my head.

271
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,638
And I admit I didn't know
what it was going to do to me.

272
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,375
But here's the thing I do know.

273
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:12,248
I am under no circumstances
going to school tomorrow.

274
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,583
Is that clear?
No school for Cory.

275
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,986
School, Cory, no.

276
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,321
All right.
Next up for oral reports--

277
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,327
Miss Lawrence and Mr. Matthews.

278
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,521
Let's go, Mr. Matthews.

279
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,860
Remove your cap
and deliver your report.

280
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,365
I can't remove my cap...

281
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,868
because our report
is on the ozone layer...

282
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:34,965
and the cap is part of
our UV-protection angle.

283
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,805
No caps in my class.

284
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:41,302
Mr. Feeny, if there was
one shred of humanity in you...

285
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,178
you'll let me keep this on.

286
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:47,676
Too many years of sixth graders
have bled me of my humanity.

287
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,381
Take off your cap.

288
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,625
[Laughing]

289
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,571
Go ahead, laugh.

290
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:08,802
Your hair looks different.
Why would I laugh?

291
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,056
over here...duck head.

292
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,082
[Laughing]

293
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,718
ToPANGA: Cory...

294
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,353
there's a seat for you here.

295
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:41,400
Tofu?

296
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:52,076
I only got one signature
on our petition.

297
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,585
It's so sad.

298
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,588
How come no one cares about
Mrs. Rosemead?

299
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,182
Because she's, like, old.

300
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:00,692
In Eastern culture...

301
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,251
old people are valued for
their knowledge.

302
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,456
Darren,

I've been meaning...

303
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:07,261
to ask you something
since the fourth grade.

304
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,268
Every day you come to school
with a cape.

305
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,963
What's the deal with the cape?

306
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,561
What cape?

307
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:19,304
Look, could someone else

take this for a while?

308
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,609
I'm getting tired of
having lima beans...

309
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,444
and spit wads
shot at me all day.

310
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,950
I'll take it.

311
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,852
I'm used to having objects
hurled at my head.

312
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:31,482
No one's going to sign
your petition.

313
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:32,752
Why not?

314
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,692
Because you're weird.

315
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,663
However,

I say that respectfully...

316
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,928
since I am now one of you.

317
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,060
But I know how
to get them to sign.

318
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,070
Why should we listen to you?

319
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,572
You didn't even know
who Mrs. Rosemead was.

320
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,268
I don't have
to know Mrs. Rosemead.

321
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:50,468
All I have to know
is the people...

322
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,410
who you want
to sign the petition.

323
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:53,912
We know who they are.

324
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,414
They're people like that
right over there.

325
00:16:56,449 --> 00:17:00,317
They might as well be
a billion miles away.

326
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,344
You don't know a thing
about them.

327
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,980
What do they like to do
after school?

328
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,752
What do they like
to watch on TV?

329
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,986
-"Crossfire"?
-"MacNeil-Lehrer Report."

330
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,724
I enjoy anything
with Angela Lansbury.

331
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:16,224
All right. I'll assume
those are all actual shows.

332
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,294
They're not watching those.

333
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,464
They're out there watching
"Beavis and Butthead."

334
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,932
ALL: Whom?

335
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,844
Exactly my point.

336
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,145
You want to sell your idea,
you need to know your buyer.

337
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,481
You got to organize,
you got to strategize.

338
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,986
And most of all...

339
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:39,390
you need people
who aren't...you.

340
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,620
Are you proposing to help us?

341
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,151
Yeah, I guess I am.

342
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,355
Why?

343
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,855
Because life is strange,
and now so am l.

344
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:08,786
oK. What I'm doing is...

345
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:12,416
I'm just trying to get
my hair back to normal.

346
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,720
Sure.

347
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,226
If you say anything...

348
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,991
I'll find some way to hurt you
when I'm older.

349
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,497
Not a word, man.

350
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:20,999
I mean, it's cool, you know.

351
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,523
Don't worry about it.

352
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,699
Hey!

353
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,799
I own you now.

354
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,312
How much longer
are we going to wait for him?

355
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:36,315
Just a couple more minutes.

356
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,317
He's not going to show.

357
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:40,410
We were stupid to believe him.

358
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,943
I feel cheap.

359
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,727
I know you people
are way too smart and mature...

360
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:53,755
to find something
as degrading as this funny.

361
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,528
[Laughing]

362
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:58,799
Look, the bell's

going to ring any second.

363
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:01,932
Are we going to help out
Mrs. Rosemead or not?

364
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,498
Let's rock 'n' roll.

365
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,111
Remember, hold your ground.

366
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,612
It's Friday afternoon...

367
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,616
and we are the only
roadblock to freedom.

368
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,140
Things could get ugly.

369
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,279
[Bell rings]

370
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,654
What are you geeks doing?
We're going to miss the bus.

371
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,662
Hey, look. It's Don King.

372
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,220
[Laughing]

373
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,856
oK, look. Here's the deal.

374
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,732
The school board is forcing
Mrs. Rosemead to retire.

375
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,999
Who cares? It's the weekend.

376
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:35,007
Come on, you guys. The woman's
been here for 40 years...

377
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,339
and they're just
putting her out to pasture.

378
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,241
Just sign our petition
and we'll move.

379
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,973
Move or die.

380
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,681
oK, you can kill us,
but think about this.

381
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,688
Mrs. Rosemead's been here
for, like, a billion years.

382
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,485
She couldn't care less
what we do.

383
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,684
Hey, Larry, tell them...

384
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,386
how you got out
of study hall last week.

385
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:57,396
I told her I was training
for the olympic decathlon.

386
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,398
And she believed you, right?

387
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,832
She bought me a discus.

388
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,563
See? She'll go for anything.

389
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,093
Now, you know
what's going to happen?

390
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,572
They're going to hire
someone young to replace her.

391
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,768
And this one's going to have
something to prove.

392
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,370
And, my good friends,
study hall as we know it...

393
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,245
is gonna be over...forever.

394
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,118
Where's the stupid petition?

395
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,518
-Cafeteria.
-I'm signing.

396
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,884
Wow.

397
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,554
You did great, Cory.

398
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:33,087
It was kind of cool
staring down an angry mob.

399
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:35,828
I never knew I had it in me.

400
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:40,032
Sometimes the reluctant warrior
is the bravest warrior.

401
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:47,304
You're not going to, like,
kiss me now, are you?

402
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,780
Would it be your first kiss?

403
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,806
Hey, don't come near me.

404
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,853
Because
it would be interesting...

405
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:59,255
if all your life you remembered
that your first kiss happened...

406
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,384
when you thought
you looked weird, wouldn't it?

407
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,863
No, it wouldn't be interesting.
Get away.

408
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:07,331
Because then you'd know.

409
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,358
It's not what you look like
on the outside that matters.

410
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,666
It's what kind of person
you are.

411
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:16,334
You shouldn't kiss somebody
you're not married to.

412
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,276
Hmm. Yeah.

413
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,836
I would have to feel
I really knew the person.

414
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,348
And that I liked him.

415
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,576
Good.

416
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,079
Good.

417
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,602
It was my first one, too.

418
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:58,016
You know,

I want to tell you something.

419
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,712
Brillo Head wouldn't have come
to your party anyway.

420
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,186
What are you talking about?

421
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:05,088
I'm talking about the hair
does not make the man.

422
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,558
And I speak
from personal experience.

423
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,527
You shouldn't
talk about people like that.

424
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,462
Don't flatter yourself, Cory.

425
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,964
We weren't
even talking about you.

426
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,898
You called me Brillo Head.

427
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:17,095
We were talking about
my sister's friend Dwayne.

428
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:20,003
We never talk about you, Cory.
We're not that bored.

429
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,233
[Laughs]

430
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,871
I see you got
your old hair back.

431
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,074
Yeah.

432
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,742
You like it better that way?

433
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,183
It's just hair.

434
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:36,120
There's still a seat for you
if you want to sit down with us.

435
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:39,022
I kind of promised the guys
I'd have lunch with them today.

436
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:40,821
Yeah, I understand.

437
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,829
Well, there's always
a seat here for you.

438
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,421
Thanks.

439
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:52,137
Hey, touch football
in my backyard after school.

440
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:55,800
Yeah. I'll be thereമഊ㤊㤹ഹ《㨰〰〺㔬〰ⴠ㸭〠㨰〰㈺〬ര㰊潦瑮挠汯牯∽昣晦て∰猠穩㵥㐱眾睷琮獶扵楴汴獥渮瑥⼼潦瑮ാ
