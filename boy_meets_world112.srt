00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,973
There has to be an answer.

179
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,474
What's the answer,

Matthews?

180
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,873
What's the answer?

181
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,542
In my opinion, 7.

182
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,919
Look at me.
What have I become?

183
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,079
A brainless pathetic moron.

184
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,918
We just went over
this material.

185
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,981
They say the
short term memory...

186
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,390
is the first thing to go.

187
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,984
Who says that?

188
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,325
I forgot!

189
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,400
The new Minkus.

190
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,493
I like him!

191
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,800
Hey, I see you guys
got the car ready.

192
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,999
I'll order the pizza...

193
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,940
and you and your little
friends can pick it up, oK?

194
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,943
Hey, thanks for
inviting me, guys.

195
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,501
I saw my mom looking...

196
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,945
at her Let's Have Fun
with Liver cookbook.

197
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,075
But she's got her bowling
league tonight, Shawn.

198
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,278
No, that ended

six weeks ago.

199
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,308
No, it didn't.

200
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,116
Yes, it did.

201
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,248
Shawn, my mom's
in that league...

202
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,281
and she's been going
every Wednesday night.

203
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,521
Well, I don't know

where she's going...

204
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,858
but it ain't bowling.

205
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:53,263
You guys all set?
I'm about ready to leave.

206
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,493
For bowling, right?

207
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,502
Yeah. Like every
Wednesday night.

208
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,561
I'm going upstairs to
say goodnight to Morgan.

209
00:08:58,605 --> 00:08:59,731
See?

210
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,866
I'm telling you, the league
ended 6 weeks ago.

211
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,342
Yeah? If there's
no bowling league...

212
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:08,404
why is my mom going out
with this big, heavy--

213
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:11,576
Eric, something's wrong.
This doesn't weigh anything.

214
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:14,052
Maybe Mom forgot her ball.

215
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,424
And if those are
bowling shoes...

216
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,425
there should be
a number on the back...

217
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,927
just above the spike heel.

218
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,929
Eric, what does this mean?

219
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,523
It means Mom's going
to be flashing some leg...

220
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,467
when she picks up
that 7-10 split.

221
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,494
"La Buggy-a."

222
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,506
La Bugia?

223
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,269
That's that fancy
dinner place...

224
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,900
seniors always
take their prom dates.

225
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,774
Why would Mom
be going there?

226
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,804
Maybe Mom's dating a senior.
I mean, everybody else is.

227
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,807
MRS. MATTHEWS:
I love you, too, pumpkin.

228
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:52,957
Morgan says she's
getting hungry...

229
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,619
so you guys better
order that pizza soon.

230
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:55,650
I'm on it.

231
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,993
Good. Hey, keep your
eye on your sister...

232
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,555
and I'll be home
around 10:00.

233
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,725
From bowling, right?

234
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,736
Where else would I be going
with my bowling bag?

235
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,261
oh, this ball weighs a ton.

236
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,399
GUYS: Ha ha ha!

237
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,033
oK, maybe it's not
as bad as it looks.

238
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,237
I sure hope so because
this looks pretty bad.

239
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,745
Does it look
as bad as liver?

240
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,747
No.

241
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,806
Why is she going
to La Bugia?

242
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,444
Why is she going to La Bugia
with a bowling bag?

243
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:23,047
Is there...
trouble in paradise?

244
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,057
Between my mom
and dad? No way!

245
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,059
They're so happy,
it's disgusting.

246
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,561
They're always kissing
and being romantic.

247
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:30,654
Are they?

248
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:33,063
or is Dad always kissing
and being romantic?

249
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,259
What are you talking about?

250
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,858
Remember this morning he
came in with a rose for her...

251
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:36,926
she didn't even care?

252
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,335
Yeah, and he poured
coffee for her...

253
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,565
and she just walked away.

254
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,540
And that kiss she gave him
this morning before she left...

255
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,939
was nothing more
than a pity kiss.

256
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,910
Believe me. I know
what they look like.

257
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,446
The main thing is, she
picked Wednesday nights.

258
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,110
The one night that Dad
has his managers' meeting.

259
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,279
Yeah, and why was she in such
a rush to leave this morning?

260
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,413
I mean, is she trying
to get away from Dad?

261
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:59,050
You don't think she
loves him anymore?

262
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,150
It could mean Worse.

263
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,320
I mean, no one goes
to La Bugia alone.

264
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,728
You think she loves
somebody else?

265
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,129
You guys better
tell your dad.

266
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,793
Tell him what?
We don't have any proof.

267
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,426
-Get proof.
-How?

268
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,495
Don't you guys watch
NYPD BLUE?

269
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,966
Tail her...

270
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,976
and talk dirty.

271
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,001
Tail her on our bikes?

272
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,876
Get on a bus. You know
where she's going.

273
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,472
Just get there,
take a look around.

274
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,642
You know, he's right.
We should do this.

275
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,946
I mean, chances are

we'll get there...

276
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,419
we'll find she's there alone...
in a cocktail dress...

277
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,422
bowling.

278
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,287
We're gonna have
to go undercover.

279
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,293
-As what?
-Two kids.

280
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:36,852
By day, two ordinary kids.

281
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,330
By night, two ordinary kids
on a bus.

282
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,727
Talking dirty.

283
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,897
We'll be back
as soon as we can.

284
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,166
Here's the 20.

285
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,798
order the pizza,
watch my house...

286
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,000
and guard my sister.

287
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,304
And if I'm killed
on this mission...

288
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,038
find out the answer
to that car wash problem...

289
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,706
from Feeny and have
Topanga channel it to me.

290
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,626
oK, what do you have?

291
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,720
3 daddies and 2 mommies.

292
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,095
A full house?

293
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:17,432
FuLL House?
I love those olsen twins.

294
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,700
MORGAN: Hi. Daddy.

295
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,331
Well, hey, sweetie.

296
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,968
What are you doing up?
It's, uh, 10:1 5.

297
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,002
Shawn was teaching me
how to play 5-card--

298
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,104
Go Fish.

299
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,413
Jacks or better to open.

300
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,919
Where's Cory and Eric?

301
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,818
They went to the library.

302
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,948
Would that be
the public library...

303
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,982
the one
that closes at 9:00?

304
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,221
No, no. The other one.

305
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,230
I'm going
to put Morgan to bed...

306
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,732
and then you and I are
gonna talk a little more.

307
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,757
Kind of a relationship
building thing?

308
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,269
No.

309
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,670
Great. First time in
my life I'm in trouble...

310
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,037
with someone else's dad.

311
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,704
Guys! Your dad
just got home.

312
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:58,802
Where is he?

313
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,813
Upstairs putting your sister
to bed. What did you find out?

314
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:01,745
Nothing good.

315
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,248
Mom Was at the club.

316
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,750
She was dancing
with some guy.

317
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,046
In those red shoes.

318
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,245
Wow!

319
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,346
Yeah, she was snuggling up
with him in a dark booth.

320
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,549
Who was it?

321
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,579
I don't know.
I couldn't tell.

322
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,648
Neither could l.

323
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,182
There were lace curtains
and plastic grapes...

324
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,489
hanging all over the place.

325
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,894
So what are you
going to do?

326
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,022
I have no idea.

327
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:21,033
I can't keep this
a secret, Eric.

328
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,864
You know me. I'll crack.

329
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,096
Dad will say,
"Good night, son."

330
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,002
And I'll say, "Mom
was with another guy!"

331
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,563
Shh!

332
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,905
Look, I mean, you're right.
We'll have to tell him.

333
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,705
Cory. Eric.

334
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,769
You know I'm
always here for you.

335
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,713
Just not right now.

336
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:36,772
oh, by the way...

337
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,841
I told him you were
at the library.

338
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,786
Great lie, Shawn.

The library closes at 9:00.

339
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,119
Yeah. He knew that, too.

340
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,092
This is not gonna
be easy to tell Dad.

341
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,094
Maybe we could just
send him a letter.

342
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,562
"Dear sir, your wife was
dancing with another guy.

343
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:52,996
Signed...
A concerned citizen."

344
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,192
MR. MATTHEWS:
Good night. Morgan.

345
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,258
oh, no. He's gonna say
good night to me next.

346
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,497
I'm gonna blow! You gotta
handle this, Eric.

347
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:01,063
Look, you just stay quiet.
Let me do all the talking.

348
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,098
Why, hey, guys.

349
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,109
Hi, Dad.

350
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,235
Where's Shawn?

351
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,438
oh, Shawn decided

to walk home.

352
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,468
I'd have driven him.

353
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,208
oh, relax, Dad. He

lives 2 blocks away.

354
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,476
Now why don't you
sit down, relax...

355
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,608
and not think that
anything terrible...

356
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,640
is going on in your life.

357
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,652
Would you like some pizza?

358
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,654
-Mmm.
-Hey, where's my change?

359
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,155
You know,

speaking of change...

360
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,681
change can be a very
positive thing in one's life...

361
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,819
especially unexpected change,
which funnily enough...

362
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,624
we'll be talking
about right now.

363
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,526
What's going on?
Where were you two?

364
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,798
Uh, well, for 2 1/2 hours...

365
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,566
we were on 4
different city buses...

366
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,972
going to and coming from
this place.

367
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,441
This place?

368
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,638
Could you be a little
more specific, please?

369
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,307
Uh, it was

a rectangular place.

370
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,083
We, uh, we were

at La Bugia, Dad.

371
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,713
Mmm!

372
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:49,722
La Bugia?

373
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,281
Mom was with another guy!

374
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,418
She was dancing.

375
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,722
With another guy!

376
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:58,663
Cory looked in the window
and recognized Mom's shoes...

377
00:14:58,698 --> 00:14:59,722
and the shoes of--

378
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,700
Do I have to draw you
a picture?

379
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,671
It's all We could see.
It Was dark.

380
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,901
There's Mom's car.

381
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,841
Quick. More pizza.

382
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:18,207
Well, I guess I'll have to have
a little talk with your mother.

383
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:23,177
Hey, I'm here for you, Dad.

384
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,713
That's why I had you, son.

385
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,698
Hey, stranger.

386
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,201
Hi.

387
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,601
Well, I just had an
interesting conversation...

388
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:39,832
with Cory and Eric.

389
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,169
Is anything wrong?

390
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,300
Yeah. We're busted.

391
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:46,209
oh, man, they found out?

392
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,805
Guess we just weren't
sneaky enough.

393
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,748
Actually,
I was sneaky enough.

394
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,875
What?

395
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:55,410
They only caught you,
you, you brazen hussy.

396
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,148
They're still talking.
That's a good sign.

397
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,091
They're not yelling?

398
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,253
Not yet.

399
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,421
oh, no. Look, as long
as they're not yelling...

400
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,158
we have a chance,

but once they go quiet...

401
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,392
that's when we're
in real trouble.

402
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,366
CORY: What's it mean
when he's smiLing?

403
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,868
-He's smiling?
-Uh-huh.

404
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:10,994
oh, no. He's lost it.

405
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,527
He's turned
into Freddie Krueger.

406
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,767
I mean, you know how Freddie
always smiles before--

407
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,570
Tch--Aah!

408
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,202
-She's gone!
-What?

409
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,645
Mom's gone! She left!
I don't see her!

410
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,273
We'll never
see her again, Eric!

411
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,511
We don't have
a mother anymore!

412
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,178
Hi, guys.

413
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,687
I overreacted.

414
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,019
Mom, are we still

a family...

415
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,048
or have we become like
an after-school special?

416
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,525
Everything is fine.

417
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,528
Are you sure? Because
Dad was smiling.

418
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,120
I understand you two...

419
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,029
did a little
detective work tonight.

420
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,931
Sorry we ratted on you, Mom.

421
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:44,163
It Was me.
I folded under torture.

422
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,000
Yeah. Dad said hello.

423
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,970
Look, I didn't go
bowling tonight.

424
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,102
Aahh...

425
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,203
And I did stop
at a gas station...

426
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,408
and change into that
dress that you saw.

427
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,508
Aahh...

428
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,109
And I did go to La Bugia...

429
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,245
and danced the night away
with the most exciting...

430
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:05,052
wonderful guy I know.

431
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:08,424
Mom, shouldn't this confession

be a little harder for you?

432
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:11,225
I was dancing
with your father.

433
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:13,824
-What?
-Dad's not our father?

434
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,793
It Was Dad!

435
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:19,168
How long have
you guys known me?

436
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,604
Since we were born?

437
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,039
Before We Were born.

438
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,668
Right! You know me
inside and out.

439
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,007
You know my heart.

440
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,775
I was dancing
with your father.

441
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,941
But I thought Dad had
a managers' meeting.

442
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,211
Bogus.

443
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,310
-Like your bowling league.
-Yeah.

444
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,820
So you guys lied to us.

445
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,517
Look, Cor, I have

a wonderful life...

446
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,025
and I love being a mother...

447
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,220
but that's just
not all of who I am.

448
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,660
I mean, I also

have a career...

449
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:46,130
and I happen to be madly
in love with my husband.

450
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,996
-Cool.
-Yecch.

451
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,630
I'm sorry you
feel that way, Cor...

452
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,728
because your father and l...

453
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,831
work very hard to keep
our relationship fresh.

454
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,007
You know, keep
the electricity going.

455
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,147
We want to stay hot
for each other.

456
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,047
Aagh...

457
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,642
Cory.

458
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,847
You guys snuck off
and lied to us.

459
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:12,016
Look, Cor,

did you ever cut school?

460
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,150
Me? No. Uh-uh.

461
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,716
off the record.

462
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,489
once in fifth grade.

463
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,553
Did you have fun?

464
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:21,556
Yeah. I went to the mall.
It was really cool.

465
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,569
Yeah, but you've been to
the mall a hundred times.

466
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,093
Now, maybe it was fun...

467
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,900
because you weren't
supposed to be there.

468
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,305
You know, like it

was a bit dangerous?

469
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:30,309
Get it?

470
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:31,674
Yeah!

471
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:32,700
No.

472
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,280
Come on, Cory.

473
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,179
I mean, it's exciting.
It's adult.

474
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:40,617
Sneaking around's romantic.
Very cool, Mom. I approve.

475
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:41,711
Thank you, Eric.

476
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:44,154
Well, I don't approve.
It sounds like you guys...

477
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,714
were just trying
to get away from us.

478
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:46,884
And I think that's wrong.

479
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,223
See, that's the fine line...

480
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,955
between being an adult
and being a kid.

481
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,486
When you're a kid,
you see everything...

482
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,623
as right or wrong,
black or white--

483
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,793
blonde or brunette.

484
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,700
But when you're an adult...

485
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:00,672
you realize that,
that not everything...

486
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,264
is as simple
as right or wrong.

487
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:06,005
I mean, sometimes

there are gray areas.

488
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,774
Any of this
make sense to you?

489
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,374
of course. I'm an adult.
You're very cool, Mom.

490
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:12,884
I'll take cool.

491
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,385
Now, if you guys
will excuse me...

492
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,251
there's a guy
in the back yard...

493
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,916
who owes me
a goodnight kiss.

494
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,688
It's OK. It's Dad.

495
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,688
Good morning.

496
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,698
[Bell rings]

497
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:06,495
Al washes a car
in 6 minutes.

498
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,474
Fred washes the same car
in 8 minutes.

499
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,773
How long will it take them
to wash the car together?

500
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:15,872
And the answer is still
not 7, Mr. Matthews.

501
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,348
I know that, sir.

502
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,510
What else do you know?

503
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,486
I know why you gave us
this word problem.

504
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,012
To suck the fun
out of our lives.

505
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,719
Yeah, that, but

the main reason is...

506
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,228
to get us to stop
thinking like kids...

507
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,594
and start thinking
like adults.

508
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,464
I know that there's not
always one right answer.

509
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,662
There may not even
be an answer at all.

510
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:39,963
Startling.

511
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,235
And how did you arrive
at that conclusion?

512
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,741
I found out that sometimes...

513
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,244
we need to learn to think
differently.

514
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:49,247
That's how Topanga knew.
Because she thinks differently.

515
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,215
Really differently.

516
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,313
Well, Mr. Matthews...

517
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,082
in all the time We've
known each other...

518
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:58,454
I don't think I've ever
been so impressed.

519
00:20:58,491 --> 00:20:59,981
Thanks, Mr. Feeny.

520
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,357
In the course
of your education...

521
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:05,921
you have been taught to look
for the right answer.

522
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:08,900
But you also must know
that in life...

523
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:13,701
many times the right answer
is that there isn't one.

524
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:19,210
This is an especially valuable
lesson for you, Mr. Minkus.

525
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:21,270
So I'm afraid
your calculations...

526
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,508
are all for naught.

527
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:24,709
Not necessarily.

528
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,719
I think I may have
inadvertently discovered...

529
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,744
the secret of time travel.

530
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,249
Did your spirit guide
talk to you...

531
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,624
and give you the answer?

532
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,754
Yeah. My mom.

533
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,668
Wait a minute.

534
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,576
Maybe time isn't a continuum.

535
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,081
Maybe it's a random
repetition of moments.

536
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,674
I think I've got it!

537
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:11,985
A continuum.

538
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:14,898
Maybe it's a random
repetition of moments.

539
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:27,879
A continuum.

540
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,780
Maybe it's a random
repetition of moments.

541
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:33,744
