There it is, the list--

00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:17,750
who made first string,
who made second string...

3
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:20,651
and who didn't even make
the basketball team.

4
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,813
What do you think is worse--

5
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,482
second string
or not making the team?

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,186
Second string.
What do you think is worse--

7
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:29,024
second string
or falling out of an airplane...

8
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:32,122
and landing on the Empire
State Building on your eye?

9
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,497
If you make second string,
you still have to sit...

10
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,797
on the bench
in front of everyone...

11
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,497
and your uniform's
always clean...

12
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,632
and you always get
a high number like 867.

13
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:43,643
Not something any of us
have to worry about, however.

14
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:47,340
We're not second string,
bench-warming, "B" team guys.

15
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,440
I made the "B" team!
I made the "B" team!

Can you believe it?
Wait till I tell my father!

17
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:57,487
Why don't we check the list?

18
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,015
Just to make sure coach
spelled our names right.

"Air" Harris. I like it.

00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,640
I'm going to have to shave this.

25
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:27,581
Wait a minute.

26
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:30,317
They spelled "A" with a "B"!

27
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,349
Duf, you're reading
the wrong line.

00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,826

It's got to be a typo.

00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:58,279
-Yeah, no big deal.
-lt doesn't change anything.

36
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,786

going to lose your friends.

what was going on
before the Neanderthaloids?

seemed rather enthused...

is, like, the next

-What?

Mr. Matthews, the lesson

that you missed today...

00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,982
was on natural selection.

87
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,894
Nature has already made
a selection for you.

is concerned...

diddly about sports.

Did you make the first string?

98
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,678
No, but maybe
that's just the coach's way...

99
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,313
of telling me to evolve.

00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,160
Eric, sit down, will you?

174
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,393
Cory, come on, tell us
all about your big game.

175
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,664
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it a big game...

176
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,169
and I wouldn't call it mine.

177
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,229
Hi, guys.
I didn't know you were home.

178
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,604
Mom, you do not want
to see me on a motorcycle...

179
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,131
-do you?
-No.

180
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,144
See, dad?

Mom wants you to buy me the car.

181
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,146
But if you really want
to hear about it...

182
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,171
-I made cookies.
-You did?

183
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,409
Because if you really
want to hear about it...

184
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,610
I'm the guy to tell you.

185
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:45,948
Yep, and mommy helped.

186
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,079
Wild Cats are down two points...

187
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,613
with only a minute left
in the game.

188
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:52,955
The ball in bounds...

189
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,653
he flies down the court
to take the pass!

190
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:58,289
He shoots! He scores!
It's a tie game!

191
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,958
Mustangs
try to toss to midcourt!

192
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:03,730
I dart between two humungoids
and snatch the ball!

193
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,897
Their only hope
is to foul me on purpose.

194
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,270
They do!

195
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:10,105
I'm at the line. There's
no time left on the clock.

196
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,610
The crowd goes nuts!

197
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,545
Cory! Cory! Cory!

198
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,516
The ball leaves my hands
and arcs in superslow motion...

199
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,518
as the crowd
goes deathly silent.

200
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,453
And then...swish!
Nothing but net!

201
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,423
The crowd goes, "Aah!"

202
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,254
I win the game!

203
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,886
-That's incredible.
-I can't believe I missed it.

204
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,089
You're such a hero, Cor.

205
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,259
No, I'm not. You know why?
I didn't even get to play.

206
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,792
I just made all that stuff up.

207
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,771
He has an active imagination.

208
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,640
You know why
I don't get to play?

209
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,840
Because I'm just a second
string, bench-warming nobody.

210
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,371
-Cory--
-First of all...

211
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,508
there's nothing wrong
with being second string.

212
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,644
Yeah, there's nothing wrong
with being second string.

213
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,018
Now, why didn't you
tell us this before, Cor?

214
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,989
He told me.

215
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,652
It's going to cost me the car,
isn't it?

216
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:01,751
Why didn't you tell us?

217
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,056
You're supposed to tell us
what he says.

218
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:06,327
That's why you sleep
in the same room with him.

219
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,732
You see? I'm trying
to spill my guts out...

220
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,633
and you guys
are having a family meeting.

221
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,728
This is why I have to make up...

222
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,966
a whole exciting life
to get any attention.

223
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,498
-oh, Cory, that isn't true.
-Yes, it is.

224
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,272
You spend half your day
with Eric at the store...

225
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,505
and the rest of the time...

226
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,446
you're talking about
his pathetic love life.

227
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,607
Hey.

228
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,549
And you're always
braiding Morgan's hair...

229
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:25,778
or making a costume for her.

230
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,217
And, I mean, I get it...

231
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,244
that she's the baby
of the family and all, but--

232
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,122
You know, being second string
in basketball is hard enough...

233
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:35,150
but I'm only on the second
string in my own family.

234
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,226
Why don't you want me
to go up and talk to him?

235
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,830
Because I think you and l
should talk first.

236
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,671
What about? Cory's had
a basketball disappointment.

237
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,404
He's overreacting.
I'm going to go tell him that.

238
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,741
Is he overreacting?

239
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,076
What does that mean,

that he's right?

240
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,239
That I spend more time
with Eric...

241
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,942
I don't care as much about him?

242
00:11:56,983 --> 00:12:01,283
No. I just think that Cory
is going through middle-pause.

243
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,881
Is that a scientific term?

244
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:07,757
Yeah. I mean, this week,

Eric has girl problems...

245
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,421
Morgan needs to be a princess...

246
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,828
and there's a kid in the middle
that didn't get heard.

247
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,128
Because
there's three of them now.

248
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,135
We let ourselves
get outnumbered.

249
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,101
Yep.
When there were two of them...

250
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,763
we had them covered man-to-man.

251
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:21,399
Now we're in a zone defense,

and Cory's problem got by us.

252
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,999
What's the game plan, coach?

253
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,875
Full court press,
double-team Cory.

254
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,210
-Go, team, go.
-Hey.

255
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,579
Just a little sport thing.

256
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,658
Wasn't that a great game
yesterday...

257
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,661
sitting on the bench,
cheering on the team?

258
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,890
I'm still pumped!

259
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,399
Minkus-Abdul Jabbar!

260
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,663
We couldn't have been
any closer to the action...

261
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,260
unless we actually played.

262
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,172
Check it out.

263
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,976
I dug out this old edition
of Sports lllustrated for you.

264
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,074
I already know
I'm not on the cover.

265
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,607
Lighten up.
There's an article in here...

266
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:08,143
on great sports figures
who sat on the bench...

267
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,620
before they got their big break.

268
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:10,782
Really?

269
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,313
Yeah.
It says that Steve Young...

270
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,417
sat on the 49ers' bench
for five years...

271
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,052
before he became
the starting quarterback.

272
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,892
And then he won MVP.

273
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,228
-Man, this is good news.
-I knew you'd like it.

274
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,496
Wow.
These are, like, major guys.

275
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,002
And they all came back
from the brink.

276
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,096
If they can do it,
you can do it.

277
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,232
Yeah! That'll prove
I'm worth something.

278
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,741
Maybe coach'll
put you in the game today.

279
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,243
Maybe you'll score
twenty points.

280
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,507
Yeah, maybe then I'll be
on the A-team permanently.

281
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,741
I'm going to be season MVP.

282
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,215
I'm going to be unstoppable!

283
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,242
Matthews, why are you suited up?

284
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,278
Second-string
doesn't go to the away games.

285
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,764

with Morgan.

288

You know, there was a time when

you used to bake cookies with--

289
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,872
And I'm talking to nobody.

290

Mr. Matthews,

what are you doing?

Uh, I'm burying a hamster.

316
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:13,403
I see you basted the little
cadaver with barbecue sauce.

317
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:18,103
Mr. Feeny, nobody's in my house.
My family's abandoned me.

318
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,704
Is that so? Why would they
do something like that?

319
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,714
Maybe because
I only made second-string...

320
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,238
and they were ashamed of me.

321
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,841
You think
that's what happened, huh?

322
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:27,443
That's why I'm trying
to survive on my own.

323
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,114
I mean,

I saw your chicken cooking...

324
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,215
and the voice of Chuck Darwin
whispered in my ear...

325
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,192
"Just do it."

326
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:37,993
Survival of the fittest,

Mr. Feeny. You taught me that.

327
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,692
In the first place,
Mr. Matthews...

328
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,223
snatching a chicken
from a grill...

329
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:45,795
is hardly chasing down
and spearing a mastodon.

330
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,239
And in the second place,
your family didn't abandon you.

331
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,300
They went
to your basketball game.

332
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,370
My family went to my game? Why?

333
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,507
one would assume that
they wanted to watch you play.

334
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,609
But, I mean, I told them...

335
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,176
second-string
doesn't get to play.

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,745
We just sit on the bench
and rot.

337
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,986
Well, then, one would assume

that they went to watch you rot.

338

My family drove
all the way to Cheltenham...

00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,562
-Yes, Mr. Matthews, they did.
-Why would they do that?

341
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,568
Well, perhaps
if you kept listening...

00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:23,064
he might've told you that
the highest form of evolution...

344
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:27,205
is a family of human beings who
genuinely care for each other.

345
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,714
What if it seems like
sometimes they don't care?

346
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,217
Sometimes you have
to give your family...

347
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,718
the benefit of the doubt.

348
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,483
That's part
of your personal evolution.

349
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,218
Do you know what happens to you
if you stop evolving?

350
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,889
I end up like this guy?

351
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,522
More or less.

352
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,795
Mr. Feeny,
we got a situation here.

353
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,733
I need you
to drive me to the game.

354
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,602
I need to drive me
to a restaurant.

355
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,004
You buried my dinner, remember?

356
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,736
I'm sorry about your chicken.

357
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,802
Drive me to the game, and
I'll buy you a couple corn dogs.

358
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,142
Tempting, but no.

359
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,172
Please, Mr. Feeny. My family's
finally there for me.

360
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:07,674
I need to be there
for me for them.

361
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,982
[Crying]

362
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14,557
oh, have some dignity, man.

363
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,289
My car's out front.

364
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:17,921
Cool. You know,

if we dust this off...

365
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,454
we can eat it on the way.

366
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,707
Ah, what a night.

367
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:32,199
Those sixth grade girls
thought I was so cool.

368
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,213
I'm going to tuck Morgan in.
I'll be right back down.

369
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,442
I want to say good night
to Cory first.

370
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,043
Well, hero,

say good night to your sister.

371
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,246
Good night, Morgan.

372
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,754
You were awesome.

373
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:47,285
Must you kiss me?

374
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,728
Well, you had yourself
a big night tonight.

375
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:56,200
Six points.
Who would've thought...

376
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,362
three first-stringers
would foul out...

377
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,962
and they'd need me to jump in?

378
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,166
Yeah,

maybe your coach learned...

379
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,333
to bring
a couple second-stringers...

380
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,639
along with him on the road
games to cover his butt, huh?

381
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:07,009
I'm really proud of the way
you handled yourself.

382
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:09,674
Three baskets
in the last minute.

383
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,182
Mr. Clutch.

384
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:14,152
Sure, we were up by thirty-one,
but still.

385
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,676
Well, I'm not talking
about basketball.

386
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,189
I'm talking about the way
you handled things today.

387
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:19,748
You come home
to an empty house...

388
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,192
there's nobody here,
but you don't panic.

389
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:24,253
You commandeer
the neighbor's car...

390
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,422
And the neighbor.

391
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,863
And you get yourself
to the game.

392
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,696
It's called
survival of the fittest.

393
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,328
I was explaining it
to Mr. Feeny earlier.

394
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,703
Well, Morgan doesn't want
to hear a story from me tonight.

395
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,766
She wants to hear a story
from the basketball star.

396
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,210
I think I can squeeze in
a little Green Eggs and Ham...

397
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:41,770
before I hit the showers.

398
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:44,647
-Hey, guys?
-Hey, Cor.

399
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,743
How come you drove
all the way out to my game?

400
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,414
I mean, you knew I was just
going to sit on the bench.

401
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,821
You must've had
something better to do.

402
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,252
Me? No.

403
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,229
Well, Cory, it really
doesn't matter to us...

404
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,994
if you sit on the bench or
if you score a hundred points.

405
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,295
Come on, it does so.

406
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,393
No, it really doesn't.
I mean, there are times...

407
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:07,338
when I catch your father
just watching you sleep.

408
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,898
only if
there's nothing good on TV.

409
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,409
You still watch me sleep?

410
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:12,911
Do you watch Eric?

411
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,743
Yeah, but I'll probably stop
when he's a senior...

412
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,749
and he gets a life.

413
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,751
Hey, thank you for your support.

414
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,309
I think I'm going
to go into the kitchen...

415
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,048
and eat something
that causes a lot of zits...

416
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,284
because it really doesn't make
any difference.

417
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,823
Look, Cor,

there's nobody in this family...

418
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,124
that's going
to be disappointed...

419
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,257
by you being second-string,
third-string, or no-string...

420
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,768
as long as
you try the best you can.

421
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,565
We're only disappointed
when you don't tell us...

422
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,162
if something's bothering you.

423
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:42,731
Well, I tried,

but nobody was listening.

424
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,903
You want to know who's
in my room telling me a story?

425
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:48,470
Nobody.

426
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,072
Come on, honey,
you have to wait a minute.

427
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,482
We're talking with Cory.

428
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:56,010
Well, look, Cory, you're going
to have to make me listen.

429
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,317
How?

430
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:02,760
Just grab my face and say,
"Hey, dad! Listen to me!"

431
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:06,731
As long as you got my face,
you got my attention.

432
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,996
-Dad?
-Yeah?

433
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,502
Let go of my face.

434
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,802
I feel kind of bad
about the things I said.

435
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,001
Uh-huh.

436
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,306
And, well...

437
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,113
Don't you hate it
when you have to apologize?

438
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:26,209
Yeah, but we don't mind

hearing them.

439
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:29,881
You know, when you're eleven,
and you start hanging out...

440
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:31,753
at a lot of other
sixth graders' houses...

441
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,259
you get to know
a lot of other parents.

442
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,726
Believe me,

I know the difference...

443
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,558
between the good ones
and the bad ones.

444
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,291
And?

445
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:43,927
And, well...

446
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,369
What do you want from me,
blood?

447
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,804
Hey!

448
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,436
Where's my story?

449
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,804
Good night.

450
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,045
Good night.

451
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,800
I'm telling you, Feeny's
a maniac behind the wheel.

452
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,931
I didn't know a Gremlin
could go that fast.

453
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:22,964
No way. Feeny?

454
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,771
The guy takes twenty minutes
to peel an orange.

455
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,902
Hey, I was in the car.

456
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:29,176
He was clipping corners,
driving on the sidewalk...

457
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:30,944
catching air off speed bumps.

458
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:34,919
our Mr. Feeny burning rubber?
I think not.

459
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,979
I thinkWhat We see
in the classroom...

460
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,684
just may be the Clark Kent side
of Mr. Feeny.

461
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:43,024
I would've had you if that light
hadn't turned yellow.

462
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:46,122
