1
00:00:00,452 --> 00:00:01,203
Gossip girl here.

2
00:00:01,204 --> 00:00:05,960
Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,013
I know who blair and those girls are,

4
00:00:08,013 --> 00:00:09,261
But I know who I am, and I'm not gonna forget that

5
00:00:09,261 --> 00:00:10,350
Just 'cause I hang out with them.

6
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:12,822
The previously mentioned excited artist is my wife.

7
00:00:12,822 --> 00:00:15,091
I thought you said the artist lived in hudson.

8
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:17,893
If the trains ever stop running. he proposed before we left,

9
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:21,115
And I'm going to say yes. take care, rufus.

10
00:00:21,115 --> 00:00:22,745
Unless you want dear nathaniel to know how

11
00:00:22,745 --> 00:00:26,583
You lost your virginity to me in the back of a moving vehicle,

12
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,190
I encourage patience and restraint.

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,086
If you're ready to forgive me, nothing can tear us apart.

14
00:00:32,087 --> 00:00:33,122
I love you, nate archibald.

15
00:00:33,122 --> 00:00:37,227
Are we really gonna do this? yeah.

16
00:00:37,227 --> 00:00:41,016
Do you like me? define "like."

17
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:00,984
What's the difference  between gossip and scandal?

18
00:01:00,984 --> 00:01:02,852
So glad you asked, ues forever.

19
00:01:02,852 --> 00:01:05,021
Anyone can commit   a minor indiscretion

20
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:07,056
And generate a day's worth of buzz,

21
00:01:07,056 --> 00:01:10,326
But in order for gossip   to birth a true scandal,

22
00:01:10,326 --> 00:01:13,663
It requires the right person   to be in the wrong place.

23
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,072
Take one "it" girl on a pedestal.

24
00:01:28,072 --> 00:01:29,641
Which one do you recommend?

25
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:31,709
Add a crowd eager to see her fall

26
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:33,511
And give them the means   to knock her down.

27
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:42,086
I can't believe this. oh, my god.

28
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:48,860
Dan!

29
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,262
What? what? what? you okay? no.

30
00:01:51,262 --> 00:01:54,332
I'fine.euh, I was just testing my screaming

31
00:01:54,332 --> 00:01:57,368
To see its screaming efficiency. well, dad,

32
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:59,428
Now I'd like to kill her, please.  what are you hiding?

33
00:01:59,428 --> 00:02:01,800
Nothing, dad, stop. you're invading my privacy. this is a loft.

34
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,477
No, stop. you guys.

35
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:12,073
Dan, you're gonna be really sorry you did that.

36
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:17,012
Jenny, would you excuse us?

37
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,355
Is there something you want to tell me?

39
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,758
Am I that obvious? yes, actually.

40
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:32,227
That hair color is all wrong for you.

41
00:02:32,227 --> 00:02:33,562
That's funny.

42
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:36,164
This isn't.

43
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,275
Please say something.

44
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:48,123
A-anything would be better than this

45
00:02:48,123 --> 00:02:50,316
"i am so disappointed in you" silence.

46
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:52,318
Since the time you could walk,

47
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,021
Your mother and i-- we knew you were special.

48
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:56,157
You were very art, very talented,

49
00:02:56,157 --> 00:02:59,594
And we promised each other we would do whatever it took

50
00:02:59,594 --> 00:03:00,851
To give you a bright future,

51
00:03:00,852 --> 00:03:04,505
And that did not include you becoming a teenage father.

52
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:06,786
Dad, this wasn't seriously, not a part of the plan,

53
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,788
But whatever serena decides to do,

54
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,790
I-i-i want to be there for her.

55
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,092
I-i have to be there for her.

56
00:03:15,565 --> 00:03:17,066
I love her.

57
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:19,469
Dan... I do.

58
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:22,472
I do, whether she's pregnant, whether she's not pregnant...

59
00:03:22,472 --> 00:03:24,140
I-i love her.

60
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,049
First things first. I think you need to talk to her.

61
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:28,005
Maybe it's not even true. did you hear what I just said?

62
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:29,847
I heard you, and I hope you heard what I said.

63
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,192
Hey, mom.

64
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:45,194
Yes, I'm pregnant, and it's yours.

65
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:49,548
Hey. I've been calling you every two seconds for the past hour.

66
00:03:49,548 --> 00:03:51,517
Oh, I left my cell at home. i-i kinda had a lot on my mind.

67
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:52,551
I know, and I'm--i'm sorry--

68
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:54,687
No, wait, wait, wait. me first.

69
00:03:54,687 --> 00:03:57,556
I'm sorry that you didn't feel that you could tell me,

70
00:03:57,556 --> 00:03:59,925
And no matter what you decide, I want you to know

71
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:02,115
That I'm here for you because i-i-i--because I love you. dan,

72
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:03,902
So you don't have to say that. I mean, you don't have to,

73
00:04:04,123 --> 00:04:08,260
Because, um, I get it. you would have done the right thing.

74
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,211
Um, thank you, though. that-- that's--that's really sweet. yeah, yeah,

75
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:13,499
Well, hey, that's good news-- the no baby part.

76
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:15,501
It's really good news, like my-dad's-probably-gonna-

77
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:18,304
Throw-a-party-good news. your dad? look, can we actually talk later?

78
00:04:18,304 --> 00:04:21,307
I'm late to meet blair. she's on the steps of the met.

79
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:23,409
Oh, yeah, no, go. go, go. it can wait,

80
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:26,412
Unlike blair, who's waiting on the steps, right? exactly. yeah.

81
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:29,448
Okay, I'll talk to you later. okay, all right.

82
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:36,422
Her new line was fabulous.

83
00:04:37,823 --> 00:04:39,191
Hi!

85
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:41,460
Jenny, hi.  you're late.

86
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,230
Yeah, I know. I had to drop some books off at the library. sorry.

87
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,832
Would you do me a favor? anything.

88
00:04:46,832 --> 00:04:48,868
Move down a couple steps.

89
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,443
You know, this whole hazing thing is getting a bit old,

91
00:04:57,443 --> 00:05:00,546
Don't you think, b.? first of all, the hazing stops when I say it stops.

92
00:05:00,546 --> 00:05:03,349
And for future reference, only my friends call me "b."

93
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,055
You know, I'm actually gonna go.

94
00:05:10,055 --> 00:05:13,526
I have a lot of stuff to do before class. jenny.

95
00:05:13,526 --> 00:05:15,861
Please, she'll be back.

96
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:17,229
Hey, you.

97
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:18,297
Hey.

98
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:24,036
Hey, guys. hey.

99
00:05:26,405 --> 00:05:28,374
I'm not pregnant.

101
00:05:28,374 --> 00:05:30,776
Aw, cool. congratulations.

102
00:05:30,776 --> 00:05:32,378
Celebratory drinks after school?

103
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:35,714
Yeah, sure. blair, can I talk to you?

104
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:37,316
Of course.

105
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:38,717
Excuse me.

106
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:43,456
Did you get my text? of course. yes, I did, but I've been--

107
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:46,459
So then you know I told dan I'm not pregnant.

108
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,195
Yes, and I am so happy for you. close call, huh?

109
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:51,430
Are we really gonna play that old game, b.?

110
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,266
I have no idea what you're talking about.

111
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:56,836
Whenever something happens that's not a part of your plan,

112
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:58,838
You pretend like it doesn't exist.

113
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:01,974
You act like you're in this movie about your perfect life,

114
00:06:01,974 --> 00:06:04,009
Then I have to remind you,

115
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:06,612
The only one watching that movie is you.

116
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:09,211
You admitted that your period was late. yes, I've been very stressed.

117
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,718
And you're acting like a total bitch

118
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:14,944
Because you're not hormonal? maybe I am a total bitch.

119
00:06:18,157 --> 00:06:20,126
Just take the test, b.

120
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:21,627
Stop it.

121
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:23,529
Just take the test.

122
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:26,866
You need to know if you and chuck are gonna have a baby.

123
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:29,368
And for a scandal   to really blow up,

124
00:06:29,368 --> 00:06:34,240
All it needs is an unexpected turn.

125
00:06:48,448 --> 00:06:50,984
Would you do me a really big favor?

126
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:52,485
What is it, sweetie?

127
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:55,689
I need you to come with me to visit my dad in rehab.

128
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:57,190
Please.

129
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,458
Really?

130
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,427
Yeah, it's just--

131
00:07:00,427 --> 00:07:02,896
It gets really awaward when I have to go alone now,

132
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:04,898
And I don't know what to say anymore.

133
00:07:04,898 --> 00:07:08,134
He loves you. you always know how to make him laugh.

134
00:07:08,134 --> 00:07:09,703
Nathaniel archibald,

135
00:07:09,703 --> 00:07:13,073
You have never asked me for anything,

136
00:07:13,073 --> 00:07:16,509
And here you are, officially leaning on me.

137
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:19,813
This time we're gonna be so much better together.

138
00:07:19,813 --> 00:07:21,514
We already are.

141
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,933
Well, at least now you know. know what? that I've wasted half the year

142
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:42,002
Trying to be friends with someone

143
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:45,005
That's never going to like me? uh, yeah. that's exactly it.

144
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:46,506
Hey. guys. so...

145
00:07:46,506 --> 00:07:48,742
Dad.

146
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,545
You're not gonna be a grandfather.

148
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:53,913
That's cool.

149
00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:57,317
That's really cool.

150
00:07:57,317 --> 00:07:59,653
Yes, yes, yes.

151
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:00,854
Yes!

152
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:03,590
Yes.

153
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,227
And I thought I was relieved. it's not all good news, though.

154
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:17,337
I-i told her I love her, and she thinks I only said that

155
00:08:17,337 --> 00:08:19,114
Because I thought she was pregnant. well, son,

156
00:08:20,273 --> 00:08:23,176
Gives you a minute to step back and enjoy being 17.

157
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:25,445
You two were moving a bit too fast anyway.

158
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:29,582
I'm late for the gallery, but we can talk more later.

159
00:08:29,582 --> 00:08:32,085
Wow. I've never seen you give up so easily.

160
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:35,088
Can you not start with me? can you not be so easy to start with?

161
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:38,692
Why are you taking his advice? he's old and alone. what?

162
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:41,194
Tell serena again without the pregnancy scare,

163
00:08:41,194 --> 00:08:43,763
In a quiet, no distractions kind of way.

164
00:08:43,763 --> 00:08:46,099
But then again, what do I know about romance,

165
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:48,068
Friends or anything else? no, no, no, no, no.

166
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:50,403
Actually, jen, that's-- that's a very good idea.

167
00:08:50,403 --> 00:08:52,072
Oh, right.

168
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:54,074
What would you do without me?

169
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:56,076
Promise me I will find out one day.

170
00:09:03,883 --> 00:09:05,218
Hey, b.

173
00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:07,454
What are you doing here? in the neighborhood.

174
00:09:07,454 --> 00:09:10,423
Can we talk later? despite your best efforts to ruin it,

175
00:09:10,423 --> 00:09:14,527
I'm actually having a good day, and I don't want anything

176
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:17,252
To spoil it. guess who asked me to visit the captain with him?

177
00:09:18,131 --> 00:09:20,091
Yes. it's like he finally needs me and isn't afraid to-- look, b.,

178
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:23,386
To burst your happy bubble, but I'm not giving up. well, I'm sorry,

179
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,374
I haven't been on the pill since I was 15. okay, I am giving up.

180
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:29,976
Before you start planning your perfect night with nate,

181
00:09:29,976 --> 00:09:32,579
Don't you think you should-- I'm not pregnant, serena.

182
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,892
What's wrong? was it something I cooked?

186
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:47,894
No. no, no, no. I'm sorry.

187
00:09:47,894 --> 00:09:49,996
It's honestly the best spaghetti I've ever tasted.

188
00:09:49,996 --> 00:09:53,400
Thank you, even if I did have to drag it out of you myself.

189
00:10:00,473 --> 00:10:02,042
Hey, guys.

191
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:03,510
Hey, jenny.

192
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,512
Go back to your room, jenny.

193
00:10:05,512 --> 00:10:08,214
I'm just getting juice.

194
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:11,551
Excuse me.

195
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,690
Hey, jen. could you do me a favor

196
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,725
And drink your juice at vanessa's, maybe?

197
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:21,594
I'm going back to my room, closing the door,

198
00:10:21,594 --> 00:10:24,776
Putting on my headphones and ignoring you and your date. excellent.

199
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,368
Where were we?

200
00:10:28,368 --> 00:10:32,072
Um...

201
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:38,278
Well, let--let's try this.

202
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:40,380
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?

203
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,282
Then it can be on our minds,

204
00:10:42,282 --> 00:10:46,453
And our minds can worry about what's on your mind, together.

205
00:10:46,453 --> 00:10:49,222
I have no idea what you just said.

206
00:10:49,222 --> 00:10:52,359
I don't know what I said either, but, um,

207
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:55,495
What I'm saying now is talk to me.

208
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,201
I never thought I was pregnant.

209
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,839
The test was for blair. oh, wait, wait. I'm confused.

210
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,376
She just got back together with nate.

211
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:11,311
So... oh. then who?

212
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:14,914
Chuck.

213
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:17,350
Chuck?

214
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,419
And blair?

215
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,955
Blair and chuck?

216
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:24,824
Then why isn't he the one buying the test? because...

217
00:11:24,824 --> 00:11:27,627
Because he's an ass. who doesn't know.

218
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:29,796
Why not?

219
00:11:29,796 --> 00:11:32,799
I mean, there's no love lost between me and chuck bass,

220
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,302
But I gotta believe he--he deserves to know.

221
00:11:35,302 --> 00:11:39,639
He--he does have this weird influence over her.

222
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,542
Maybe he could talk her into taking the test.

223
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:45,946
I just-- I'm so worried about her.

224
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:48,148
Come here.

225
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:56,489
This may be the most amazing purchase you'll ever make

226
00:11:56,489 --> 00:12:00,093
In your entire lovely existence. your day almost over?

227
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:01,192
Not quite. I've got a few canvases to wrap

228
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:02,467
And a little more paperwork.

229
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:05,177
I'm trying to get you to ask me out for after-work drinks.

230
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:09,843
Oh, oh. uh, okay.

231
00:12:09,843 --> 00:12:11,945
I'm sorry I didn't realize,

232
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:20,554
I guess you're not done for the day after all,

233
00:12:20,554 --> 00:12:23,156
But when you are, call me.

234
00:12:29,463 --> 00:12:31,498
Hi, rufus. remember me?

235
00:12:31,498 --> 00:12:33,934
Bex, right? art dealer.

236
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:36,102
Yeah, you bought a very special piece

237
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:37,604
For lily van der woodsen.

238
00:12:37,604 --> 00:12:40,607
I'm looking for some things for a couple other clients.

239
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:44,211
Any new discoveries since the last time I was here? a few.

240
00:12:44,211 --> 00:12:47,681
There's a beautiful mixed media piece on this wall over here.

241
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:54,454
As I recall, you had a wife in hudson.

242
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:56,022
That still true?

243
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:58,658
Uh, she's still there. I'm still here.

244
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:00,694
Made things a little difficult.

245
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:03,830
Still trying?

246
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,466
I'm trying to move on.

247
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:08,935
Hmm. tomorrow night too soon to start?

248
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:14,641
I suppose not.

249
00:13:14,641 --> 00:13:16,076
Sounds good.

250
00:13:16,076 --> 00:13:18,245
Okay.

251
00:13:26,086 --> 00:13:27,420
Hi, chuck.

253
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,523
Please, call me "brother."

254
00:13:29,523 --> 00:13:31,558
I need to talk to you.

255
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:33,560
About getting knocked up? I must say

256
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,663
I was a little disappointed you weren't more careful.

257
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:44,337
Chuck, I really need to trust you.

258
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:46,339
I'm hoping that deep down inside,

259
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:48,341
You're actually a decent person

260
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:50,510
And won't make me regret this.

261
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,512
You're here for blair, aren't you?

262
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:56,116
Look, I'm not going to tell nate about us.

263
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:58,118
I tortured her, got bored and moved on.

264
00:13:58,118 --> 00:14:00,153
There's no moving on just yet.

265
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:02,823
The pregnancy test wasn't for me. it was for blair.

266
00:14:02,823 --> 00:14:06,092
What? she won't take it.

267
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:09,696
So given that if she's pregnant, you're the-- no, we used a condom.

268
00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:12,098
Well, obviously, it broke. what is obvious

269
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:15,101
Is that your best friend has kept you in the dark.

270
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:17,704
What are you talking about? like I said,

271
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:19,906
I handle my business. apparently, nate doesn't.

272
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:23,710
They slept together just after we did.

273
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,580
It's him you should be asking for help.

274
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:29,983
Hey, dad.

275
00:14:29,983 --> 00:14:32,252
I need to talk to to you about something.

276
00:14:32,252 --> 00:14:35,322
Whoa, whoa, whoa. it's a little early in the morning

277
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:37,657
For the teens-gone-wild contingency plan, isn't it?

278
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:40,594
It's not about your relationship with serena. oh. oh, then what?

279
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:43,463
I need to know how you and jenny would feel

280
00:14:43,463 --> 00:14:46,333
If I went out tonight for a drink... with a woman.

281
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,870
Well, I guess I feel like you shouldn't wear that shirt,

282
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,272
Or there will not be a second date.

283
00:14:52,272 --> 00:14:53,807
Really? r-really.

284
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:55,308
Thanks.

285
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:58,445
Now I guess I just have to worry about jenny then.

286
00:14:58,445 --> 00:15:00,313
Good morning. hi.

287
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:02,649
Good morning, sunshine.

288
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:06,119
Dad, where'd you get that shirt?

289
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:08,955
What's wrong with this shirt? nothing,

290
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:11,958
As long as you don't plan to wear it out of the house.

291
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,661
It's worse. he plans on wearing it on a date.

292
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:17,664
For drinks, if that's okay. whatever. it's awful.

293
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:20,433
Guess you have your answer. answer to what?

294
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:22,302
Nothing. nothing.

295
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:33,647
Morning.

297
00:15:33,647 --> 00:15:35,282
Good morning, miss serena.

298
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:38,185
Anybody notice the weather today? what?

299
00:15:38,185 --> 00:15:40,487
Take a look outside, b. my first response

300
00:15:40,487 --> 00:15:43,323
Would be that the sky is a clear blue easy.

301
00:15:43,323 --> 00:15:46,493
Dorota, you may be excused now.

302
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:52,499
I can't believe you didn't tell me about you and nate.

303
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:56,102
What did he say? noing. chuck did, when I went to see him

304
00:15:56,102 --> 00:15:59,105
Because I thought maybe he could talk some sense into you.

305
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:01,520
You had no right to do that. I was trying to help you, b.

306
00:16:02,876 --> 00:16:05,312
Let another rumor about me run rampant.

307
00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:08,014
The whole school heard, even dan.

308
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:09,616
What's going on?

309
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:15,355
Ask blair. her version of the story's always better.

310
00:16:17,424 --> 00:16:18,859
Fine.

311
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:24,064
You all right?

312
00:16:24,064 --> 00:16:25,565
Never been better.

313
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:28,168
Well, serena has. what's wrong?

314
00:16:28,168 --> 00:16:31,271
I don't know. I can't be held responsible for her mood swings.

315
00:16:31,271 --> 00:16:33,340
Were you arguing

316
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,841
About the possibility

317
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:38,011
That your condition may have returned?

318
00:16:38,011 --> 00:16:40,580
No. and it hasn't.

319
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,949
I heard you...

320
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:44,518
The other day,

321
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:48,255
In your bathroom, with the water running.

322
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:50,223
I'm very stressed.

323
00:16:50,223 --> 00:16:52,592
And with you and serena down my throat,

324
00:16:52,592 --> 00:16:55,562
I can hardly think straight, never mind keep food down.

325
00:16:55,562 --> 00:16:59,099
Maybe you do just need to take a little bak, , h?

326
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:02,102
Visit your father? lyon is beautiful this time of year. maybe this summer.

327
00:17:02,102 --> 00:17:05,038
Summer sounds great. finish your breakfast.

328
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:19,853
I'm not pregnant.

331
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:22,155
I command myself not to be pregnant.

332
00:17:26,226 --> 00:17:28,595
Hello? hey, s. it's b.

334
00:17:28,595 --> 00:17:30,497
Two things.

335
00:17:30,497 --> 00:17:32,799
First... I'm sorry

336
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,502
About dan, about the "gossip girl" blast

337
00:17:35,502 --> 00:17:37,904
And about not telling you about nate. okay.

338
00:17:37,904 --> 00:17:40,006
You were just so hard on me about chuck.

339
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:43,009
I didn't want to be judged for sleeping with them both.

340
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:44,678
I understand. apology accepted.

341
00:17:44,678 --> 00:17:46,346
That was fast. if I were you,

342
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:49,082
I would've made me work for it a little bit harder.

343
00:17:49,082 --> 00:17:51,918
Well, I think you've suffered enough. and second thing--

344
00:17:51,918 --> 00:17:54,668
Wait. that's already, like, three things. I took the test.

345
00:17:55,522 --> 00:17:57,524
Aah!  oh, my gosh! are you kidding me?

346
00:17:57,524 --> 00:17:58,959
Aah!

347
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:00,961
Oh, I am so happy.

348
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:04,931
I would have had no idea what to wear to a paternity hearing. clean slate?

349
00:18:04,931 --> 00:18:07,067
Oh, clean slate. oh, I'm so happy.

350
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:08,635
See you at school.

351
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:21,348
Oh, don't stop on my account. oh, I have to.

353
00:18:21,348 --> 00:18:24,651
Secondhand smoke is bad for the, uh... I'm not pregnant, so good-bye,

354
00:18:24,651 --> 00:18:27,654
Mistake so far in my past I can hardly remember.

355
00:18:27,654 --> 00:18:29,856
You cannot be serious. you can't be touching me.

356
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:32,092
Look, if you were gonna tell nate,

357
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:32,807
You would have done so in monaco,

358
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:34,833
But you don't want him to hate you, and you know he would.

359
00:18:35,513 --> 00:18:38,452
Game over. game's not over until I say it is.

360
00:18:38,803 --> 00:18:40,634
Then have fun playing with yourself.

361
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:20,340
Got 'em.

362
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,877
Are--are--are you cold? I'm okay.

363
00:19:23,877 --> 00:19:26,847
It's pretty cold. here, let me get you this blanket.

364
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,382
This will be better to keep you warm.

365
00:19:29,382 --> 00:19:31,418
Um, you--you want some ginger ale?

366
00:19:31,418 --> 00:19:33,420
Here. I brought this for us.

367
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,422
We can have a nice little drink.

368
00:19:35,422 --> 00:19:37,457
Um, it might be a little cold, actually.

369
00:19:37,457 --> 00:19:39,826
I--you okay? you're doing that, um... thing.

370
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:43,163
Yeah, i-i know. I'm sorry. i...

371
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:45,265
It's just... i-i don't know.

372
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:48,468
In--in the short time we've known each other,

373
00:19:48,468 --> 00:19:51,304
You--you've become really important to me.

374
00:19:51,304 --> 00:19:54,307
I've been struggling to find a way to tell you,

375
00:19:54,307 --> 00:19:56,877
Struggling now.

376
00:19:56,877 --> 00:19:58,879
Oh, my lit paper. no, no, no, no, no.

377
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:01,081
Oh! no, no, no, no, no, no.

378
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:03,116
Oh, my gosh. here you go.

379
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:05,152
I love you. thank you.

380
00:20:05,152 --> 00:20:07,854
No problem. all right, take care.

381
00:20:07,854 --> 00:20:09,756
That was a close call.

382
00:20:09,756 --> 00:20:12,459
I'm sorry. that would've completely ruined our picnic.

383
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:14,594
Yeah.

384
00:20:14,594 --> 00:20:17,230
Okay, what, um, what was it you were saying?

385
00:20:19,032 --> 00:20:21,101
Oh, just...

386
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:24,471
I think I should proofread this for you. can i?

387
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:27,841
Sure. yeah, but can we eat first? 'cause I'm starving.

388
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:29,409
Yeah. let's eat.

389
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:38,251
Can you believe this?

392
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:40,253
Jenny, come look at this.

393
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:43,256
Looks like the virgin queen

395
00:20:43,256 --> 00:20:45,492
Isn't as pure   as she pretended to be.

396
00:20:45,492 --> 00:20:49,196
Who's your daddy, b.?   baby daddy, that is.

397
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:52,632
Two guys in one week?   talk about doing the nasty,

398
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:54,209
Or should I just say   being nasty?

399
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:57,212
Oh, my god. you know she's right about this.

400
00:20:57,212 --> 00:21:00,715
Oh, god, there she is. what a total hypocrite.

401
00:21:00,715 --> 00:21:02,951
Who does she think she is?

402
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:04,494
Pot calling the kettle black much?

403
00:21:06,354 --> 00:21:09,324
Oh, I can see a bump! what a bitch.

404
00:21:09,324 --> 00:21:10,769
Oh, my god, she is such a whore.

405
00:21:13,027 --> 00:21:15,363
She cheated on nate?! does nate know?

406
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:17,532
Oh, god!

407
00:21:17,532 --> 00:21:19,501
Have you seen nate?

408
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:21,536
No.

409
00:21:28,543 --> 00:21:29,978
I saw it.

411
00:21:29,978 --> 00:21:33,214
Yeah, blair's gonna freak out. I mean, this is a total lie.

412
00:21:33,214 --> 00:21:34,916
Yeah.

413
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,551
Of course it is.

414
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,356
Jenny, look, I know you're friends with blair,

415
00:21:41,356 --> 00:21:44,926
And you'd never want to do anything to betray her,

416
00:21:44,926 --> 00:21:48,196
But if you know something... well, blair was never really my friend.

417
00:21:48,196 --> 00:21:49,464
So...

418
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:52,967
So...

419
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:55,336
Yeah, there's something you should know.

420
00:21:57,071 --> 00:21:59,841
I don't know if you would want to her...

421
00:21:59,841 --> 00:22:01,276
Whoa, man!

422
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:03,711
Did you sleep with her, huh?

423
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:04,764
You son of a bitch. I could kill you.

424
00:22:06,414 --> 00:22:08,583
What'd you do? did you get what you wanted,

425
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:12,720
Like you do with all those other girls? yes, nathaniel. I took what blair

426
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,391
Kept throwing at you and you kept throwing back.

427
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:16,324
Oh, so somehow you screwing blair for sport is my fault?

428
00:22:16,324 --> 00:22:18,860
It wasn't for sport. she needed someone, and I was there.

429
00:22:18,861 --> 00:22:20,195
Oh, so you cared about her?

430
00:22:20,195 --> 00:22:23,398
You guys were broken up. what, for how long? a week? an hour?

431
00:22:23,398 --> 00:22:26,067
Look, I am sorry, all right?

432
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:28,521
I know how long you and I have been best friends, okay?

433
00:22:28,522 --> 00:22:29,771
No, it's not okay, chuck.

434
00:22:29,771 --> 00:22:32,373
From now on, you stay away from me. nate.

435
00:22:32,373 --> 00:22:34,442
Did you hear what I said?

436
00:22:34,442 --> 00:22:36,911
You stay the hell away from me, chuck!

437
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:42,884
Show's over.

438
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:55,997
What are you doing here? your mom let me in.

440
00:22:55,997 --> 00:22:59,067
I didn't ask how you got in. I asked why you came.

441
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:02,103
To talk.... about us.

442
00:23:02,103 --> 00:23:04,606
There's no "us," blair.

443
00:23:04,606 --> 00:23:07,809
Yes, there is. we finally really have a chance to start over.

444
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:10,845
You know, all this time, I felt so b for everything I've done,

445
00:23:10,845 --> 00:23:13,982
And when you said you wanted to leave the past in the past,

446
00:23:13,982 --> 00:23:15,800
I didn't know we were talking about your past.

447
00:23:16,985 --> 00:23:18,701
I made a decision I was in no condition to make.

448
00:23:19,988 --> 00:23:22,824
Yes. then you'll understand perfectly when I say

449
00:23:22,824 --> 00:23:25,260
I want nothing else to do with you, blair.

450
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,315
You and chuck deserve each other. you know chuck would say anything,

451
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:29,597
But jenny wouldn't. jenny?

452
00:23:29,597 --> 00:23:32,600
And don't go blaming any of this on her, blair.

453
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,436
I would have found out eventually. I said I'm done.

454
00:23:35,436 --> 00:23:37,772
It's over. now would you please leave?

455
00:23:37,772 --> 00:23:40,708
Fine. stay as long as you like. I'll leave.

456
00:23:50,118 --> 00:23:53,855
Bryn. hi.

457
00:23:53,855 --> 00:23:55,523
Good to see you again.

458
00:23:55,523 --> 00:23:58,059
Rufus, at the risk of being forward,

459
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:01,062
I'm here on a dare from my friends to ask you out.

460
00:24:01,062 --> 00:24:03,998
Then I guess I have to say, uh...

461
00:24:03,998 --> 00:24:05,800
Yes? yes, you do.

462
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,370
Well, tonight, I have plans, but maybe some other night...

463
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,940
Am I interrupting?

464
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,175
Hi.

465
00:24:14,175 --> 00:24:16,377
Uh, bryn, bex. bex, bryn.

466
00:24:16,377 --> 00:24:19,280
Actually, I'm bex. she must be... bryn.

467
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,683
I always get a little tongue-tied with my b's.

468
00:24:21,683 --> 00:24:23,985
Looks like you're still tied up.

469
00:24:23,985 --> 00:24:27,355
Maybe we should reschedule drinks. no, that-- that won't be necessary.

470
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:33,561
Actually, I think it will. good to meet you, bryn.  you, too. bye.

471
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:37,065
Guess you're available after all.

472
00:24:41,803 --> 00:24:43,471
Hey, b. what's up?

474
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:49,711
I can't believe you told jenny about me and chuck.

475
00:24:49,711 --> 00:24:51,646
What? i-i didn't.

476
00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:53,915
Because of her, everybody knows the intimate details

477
00:24:53,915 --> 00:24:56,766
Of my private life, and now nate's not speaking to me. but i-i told you,

478
00:24:56,885 --> 00:25:01,055
I didn't tell jenny. I don't know how she found out. did you tell dan?

479
00:25:01,055 --> 00:25:03,224
What?

480
00:25:03,224 --> 00:25:05,927
You did. you told your low-rent boyfriend,

481
00:25:05,927 --> 00:25:08,563
And he told his social-climbing sister

482
00:25:08,563 --> 00:25:11,399
Who wears my hand-me-downs, and she blabbed to nate.

483
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:13,902
I can't believe you're attacking dan and jenny.

484
00:25:13,902 --> 00:25:16,404
Did you or did you not tell him?

485
00:25:21,576 --> 00:25:22,911
I did,

486
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:25,246
But only because you weren't dealing with it,

487
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:29,150
And I wanted advice on how to help you. I can't believe you don't get it.

488
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,585
The rules are different

489
00:25:30,585 --> 00:25:32,787
For the serena van der woodsens of the world.

490
00:25:32,787 --> 00:25:35,723
People expect you to party and be wild,

491
00:25:35,723 --> 00:25:38,065
Sleep with whoever you want, run away, come back. wait,

492
00:25:39,427 --> 00:25:41,863
You shot your reputation to hell a long time ago.

493
00:25:41,863 --> 00:25:43,677
It doesn't matter what you do, but I'm a waldorf. well,

494
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:46,668
Obviously don't need me and my low-rent taste,

495
00:25:46,668 --> 00:25:49,404
You and the waldorf name can weather the storm alone.

496
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,520
With pleasure.

498
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:08,323
Hey, jenny.

499
00:26:08,323 --> 00:26:09,324
Hi.

500
00:26:09,324 --> 00:26:11,826
Are you joining us? um...

501
00:26:11,826 --> 00:26:15,096
What are you doing here? I was just leaving.

502
00:26:15,096 --> 00:26:16,831
No, stay.

503
00:26:16,831 --> 00:26:19,334
Blair, given you can barely manage your own messy affairs,

504
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:22,670
Surely you're not in a position to tell anyone

505
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,640
Where they can and can't eat. do you realize who you're talking to?

506
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,642
You mean a self-righteous bitch who always sat

507
00:26:27,642 --> 00:26:30,578
On her own high horse judging everyone else? pregnant little hypocrite.

508
00:26:30,578 --> 00:26:32,914
Not that it's any of your business,

509
00:26:32,914 --> 00:26:34,449
But I'm not pregnant.

510
00:26:34,449 --> 00:26:37,719
Nate must be thrilled. chuck, too.

511
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:39,754
What are you talking about?

512
00:26:39,754 --> 00:26:41,689
The whole school saw them throwing down

513
00:26:41,689 --> 00:26:43,424
Over your cheap ass.

514
00:26:43,424 --> 00:26:46,661
The boyfriend and the best friend? pretty classy.

515
00:26:46,661 --> 00:26:48,863
Consider yourself dethroned,

516
00:26:48,863 --> 00:26:50,298
Queen b.

517
00:26:59,474 --> 00:27:00,675
Nn jey.consider yourself dethroned,

518
00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:05,847
It is highly unlikely

519
00:27:05,847 --> 00:27:08,883
That I will ever forgive you for going to nate,

520
00:27:08,883 --> 00:27:11,119
But if you walk away from me now,

521
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:12,954
I will also ruin you.

522
00:27:17,258 --> 00:27:21,629
How are you gonna do that?

523
00:27:31,739 --> 00:27:33,408
Good to see you again.

525
00:27:33,408 --> 00:27:35,410
Okay. bye. take care. enjoy.

526
00:27:45,553 --> 00:27:47,989
Hi. it's bex.   you know what to do.

529
00:27:49,257 --> 00:27:51,326
Hi. it's rufus,

531
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:57,298
Calling again to apologize about last night again.

532
00:27:57,298 --> 00:28:00,401
I really didn't mean to insult you or disrespect you

533
00:28:00,401 --> 00:28:02,837
Or whatever it is I did.

534
00:28:02,837 --> 00:28:04,973
I'm new at this, and well...

535
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:08,543
I'm new at this.

536
00:28:13,848 --> 00:28:16,818
You told jenny about blair and chuck?

537
00:28:18,286 --> 00:28:20,155
No. no, of course not.

538
00:28:20,155 --> 00:28:22,524
Well, you're the only one I told.

539
00:28:22,524 --> 00:28:25,527
And I didn't tell anybody.

540
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:28,463
How can I know that?

541
00:28:28,463 --> 00:28:30,732
Because I gave you my word.

542
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:36,271
Because I love you.

543
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:38,706
What?

544
00:28:38,706 --> 00:28:41,309
I love you,

545
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:44,779
And not just because I thought you were pregnant

546
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:46,781
And not in the way you love

547
00:28:46,781 --> 00:28:48,783
Some random guy who picks up your lit paper

548
00:28:48,783 --> 00:28:51,119
Or some girl who likes your hair.

550
00:28:54,589 --> 00:28:55,723
Okay.

551
00:28:55,723 --> 00:28:58,726
"okay"?

552
00:29:03,565 --> 00:29:06,201
That response is not okay.

554
00:29:50,912 --> 00:29:53,414
I'm such an ass. let me guess. dan?

555
00:29:56,351 --> 00:29:58,353
He told me loved me,

557
00:29:58,353 --> 00:30:01,489
And all I did was stand there like a stupid mute.

558
00:30:01,489 --> 00:30:03,892
I mean, why wouldn't I want to hear those words

559
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:06,928
Come out of his mouth? but it's like it made me trust him less,

560
00:30:06,928 --> 00:30:09,931
Which is crazy, and even if he is lying about telling jenny,

561
00:30:09,931 --> 00:30:12,767
Even though I told him not to tell anyone,

562
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:14,221
I should have come up with a better response to "i love you.

563
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,773
But why would you think he was lying? because I'm the only one who knew,

564
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:19,908
And he's the only one I told.

565
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:24,546
On your conversations when you thought I wasn't? ooh. none, I hope.

566
00:30:24,546 --> 00:30:26,781
You hope wrong. I'm a little brother.

567
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:29,784
It's what I do, and you don't have to be a genius

568
00:30:29,784 --> 00:30:32,353
To figure out the trust thing. I mean, every time

569
00:30:32,353 --> 00:30:35,390
Mom brought home someone who said, "i love you,"

570
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,459
They would end up married. and then divorced.

571
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:40,929
Didn't leave us with a strong sense of trust, huh?

572
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:43,398
But that's mom's issue, not ours,

573
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:46,401
And dan's not one of those guys.

574
00:30:46,401 --> 00:30:48,403
Okay, this conversation has to end,

575
00:30:48,403 --> 00:30:51,105
Because you're getting dangerously close

576
00:30:51,105 --> 00:30:52,907
To being smarter than I am,

577
00:31:13,695 --> 00:31:15,697
No, thank you. all right.

579
00:31:24,873 --> 00:31:27,642
I came to congratulate you in person.

580
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:33,414
You ruined my relationship with nate,

581
00:31:33,414 --> 00:31:36,985
Serena, all of my friends.

582
00:31:36,985 --> 00:31:39,354
Even little jenny thinks she's too good for me,

583
00:31:39,354 --> 00:31:40,822
So... bravo.

584
00:31:40,822 --> 00:31:42,857
Just like you wanted.

585
00:31:42,857 --> 00:31:45,894
I have no one to turn to but you.

586
00:31:45,894 --> 00:31:47,829
Actually, you don't even have me.

587
00:31:47,829 --> 00:31:49,998
Enough.

588
00:31:49,998 --> 00:31:52,534
I'll try to be more succinct.

589
00:31:52,534 --> 00:31:56,437
You held a certain fascination

590
00:31:56,437 --> 00:31:58,039
When you were beautiful,

591
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:00,275
Delicate...

592
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:02,777
And untouched.

593
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:06,981
But now you're like...

594
00:32:06,981 --> 00:32:12,353
One of the arabians my father used to own--

595
00:32:12,353 --> 00:32:16,124
Rode hard and put away wet.

596
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:22,063
I don't want you anymore,

597
00:32:22,063 --> 00:32:25,099
And I can't see why anyone else would.

598
00:33:16,918 --> 00:33:18,253
You okay?

601
00:33:18,253 --> 00:33:21,456
I'd be a lot better if I could spend a semester

602
00:33:21,456 --> 00:33:24,392
Going to school in france.

603
00:33:24,392 --> 00:33:27,262
A semester?

604
00:33:27,262 --> 00:33:30,064
Well, i-i already talked to harold about a visit,

605
00:33:30,064 --> 00:33:32,066
And he was-- he was thrilled.

606
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:34,469
So can I go?

607
00:33:34,469 --> 00:33:35,770
Now?

608
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:38,072
Mom, please try.

609
00:33:40,441 --> 00:33:42,844
Blair, I am very concerned.

610
00:33:42,844 --> 00:33:44,546
So book a flight.

611
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:53,254
We'll get you out tomorrow.

612
00:33:56,257 --> 00:33:58,560
Thank you.

613
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,608
Who's up for a barneys drive-by?

614
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:17,111
Me. ooh. followed by hot sake at decibel.

615
00:34:17,111 --> 00:34:20,515
Huh. I don't think so. yeah. she made out with the bartender last time.

616
00:34:20,515 --> 00:34:23,785
Now he thinks she loves him. what about you, little j.?

617
00:34:23,785 --> 00:34:27,255
Oh, I can't. I have to return these books to the library.

618
00:34:27,255 --> 00:34:29,958
Elise will take them for you,

619
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:31,459
Won't you, e.?

620
00:34:31,459 --> 00:34:32,760
Yeah, sure.

621
00:34:34,395 --> 00:34:36,397
It's okay. I can do it.

622
00:34:36,397 --> 00:34:38,900
The question isn't if you can do it, jenny,

623
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,469
It's if you should have to.

624
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:43,037
I'm going there anyway.

625
00:34:50,111 --> 00:34:52,046
Okay.

626
00:34:54,482 --> 00:34:57,385
Let me know if you need anything else.

627
00:35:05,794 --> 00:35:07,896
You coming?

628
00:35:13,301 --> 00:35:16,838
Props to blair. she trained you well.

629
00:35:32,086 --> 00:35:34,989
Hi.

630
00:35:34,989 --> 00:35:36,291
Hi.

631
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:38,993
Don't act so surprised to see me.

632
00:35:38,993 --> 00:35:40,995
How could I not stop by

633
00:35:40,995 --> 00:35:43,465
After all those pitiful messages you left? oh, for the record,

634
00:35:43,465 --> 00:35:47,168
I'm really sorry for what happened the other night. so am i.

635
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:52,841
Look, bex, I was married for almost 20 years,

636
00:35:52,841 --> 00:35:55,743
And before that, I was a somewhat successful musician,

637
00:35:55,743 --> 00:35:58,913
And I wouldn't really call what I was doing dating. what was it then?

638
00:35:58,913 --> 00:36:00,715
A succession of women--

639
00:36:00,715 --> 00:36:03,751
Groupies, mostly-- whose chose me.

640
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:06,020
I really don't have any experience

641
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,590
With real honest-to-goodness dating.

642
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:13,528
Despite your worst efforts,

643
00:36:13,528 --> 00:36:16,197
I am completely charmed by you, rufus humphrey.

644
00:36:16,197 --> 00:36:17,765
Thanks, I think.

645
00:36:17,765 --> 00:36:20,468
Okay.

646
00:36:20,468 --> 00:36:22,403
Here's where we are.

647
00:36:22,403 --> 00:36:25,373
Dating 101, lesson 1.

648
00:36:25,373 --> 00:36:27,375
In two days, you're gonna call me

649
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:30,411
And thank me for forgiving you of your dating faux pas.

650
00:36:30,411 --> 00:36:33,047
You'll ask me out to dinner-- someplace elegant

651
00:36:33,047 --> 00:36:35,783
But intimate, and we are going to have a fabulous time.

652
00:36:35,783 --> 00:36:37,619
You got all that? absolutely.

653
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:40,121
Good. talk to you in two days. two days.

654
00:36:40,121 --> 00:36:42,357
Okay.

655
00:36:49,464 --> 00:36:51,499
Hello?

659
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:54,369
I never was good at following rules.

660
00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:01,709
Hey. what are you doing here?

662
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:04,179
I need to know why you love me.

663
00:37:06,781 --> 00:37:09,184
Because I do.

664
00:37:13,855 --> 00:37:17,225
I really want to trust you when you say those words, dan,

665
00:37:17,225 --> 00:37:21,629
So maybe if I knew why, I'd stop being so scared of hearing them

666
00:37:21,629 --> 00:37:23,631
And afraid to say them.

667
00:37:23,631 --> 00:37:26,100
Okay.

668
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,303
Well, if you want to talk about why--

669
00:37:28,303 --> 00:37:30,705
It has to do with my mom and her many marriages.

670
00:37:30,705 --> 00:37:32,874
There. that's why.

671
00:37:32,874 --> 00:37:35,376
Because I actually like it when you interrupt me,

672
00:37:35,376 --> 00:37:39,514
Which is often, by the way.

673
00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:41,483
I love you because you make no apologies

674
00:37:41,483 --> 00:37:43,918
About being exactly who you are--

675
00:37:43,918 --> 00:37:46,354
Beautiful, smart,

676
00:37:46,354 --> 00:37:47,856
Sexy as hell--

677
00:37:47,856 --> 00:37:50,291
Now you're embarrassing me.

678
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:51,759
That's another reason.

679
00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:55,697
You're completely unaware of your affect on me.

680
00:37:55,697 --> 00:37:57,198
You're also completely unaware

681
00:37:57,198 --> 00:37:59,801
That you laugh like a 4 year old.

682
00:37:59,801 --> 00:38:03,404
Just like that.

683
00:38:03,404 --> 00:38:06,941
And I love you because you can be with someone like me

684
00:38:06,941 --> 00:38:09,744
And still be best friends with someone like blair.

685
00:38:09,744 --> 00:38:12,614
Yeah, well, I tried to be.

686
00:38:12,614 --> 00:38:16,017
I know you do, and that's not easy,

687
00:38:16,017 --> 00:38:18,086
But you never give up on her.

688
00:38:18,086 --> 00:38:21,656
That is how amazing you are.

689
00:38:23,324 --> 00:38:27,562
Well, you're amazing, too,

690
00:38:27,562 --> 00:38:31,866
For being able to say all of those things,

691
00:38:31,866 --> 00:38:33,368
You just are.

692
00:38:43,077 --> 00:38:46,781
And I love you...

693
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:48,750
But I have to go.

694
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,352
What? what--what is it this time?

695
00:38:51,352 --> 00:38:53,855
One of the many reasons you love me.

696
00:39:15,376 --> 00:39:17,111
Blair.

698
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:18,413
What?

699
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:20,448
You want a lift to j.f.k.?

700
00:39:20,448 --> 00:39:22,717
Your mom said you were going to france tonight.

701
00:39:22,717 --> 00:39:25,186
She has a big mouth. b., I'm your best friend.

702
00:39:25,186 --> 00:39:27,789
She was shocked I didn't know.

703
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:30,091
Well, now you do.

704
00:39:30,091 --> 00:39:33,294
What I know is how you felt when I left without telling you.

705
00:39:33,294 --> 00:39:36,631
Is there a reason you're here?

706
00:39:36,631 --> 00:39:38,633
Stay.

707
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:41,569
Don't let some stupid scandal make you run away

708
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:44,706
Like it did me, like it does everyone in our world.

709
00:39:51,012 --> 00:39:52,547
Everything's horrible.

710
00:39:54,215 --> 00:39:57,085
My whole life is falling apart.

711
00:39:57,085 --> 00:40:00,188
So rebuild it.

712
00:40:00,188 --> 00:40:01,790
You're a waldorf, remember?

713
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:05,326
People don't tell you who you are. you tell them.

714
00:40:05,326 --> 00:40:08,463
Stay and fight.

715
00:40:08,463 --> 00:40:10,198
I'll fight with you.

716
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:16,237
I'm so embarrassed.

717
00:40:16,237 --> 00:40:17,672
I'm so

718
00:40:17,672 --> 00:40:20,475
So what?

719
00:40:20,475 --> 00:40:22,010
Start over.

720
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,245
It can be done.

721
00:40:24,245 --> 00:40:26,614
I should know.

722
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:32,387
We'll get through this together.

723
00:40:32,387 --> 00:40:34,622
Promise?

724
00:40:34,622 --> 00:40:37,859
Promise.

725
00:41:01,649 --> 00:41:03,985
Stop, guys.

726
00:41:03,985 --> 00:41:05,520
I'm going home.

727
00:41:23,805 --> 00:41:25,974
One good scandal   deserves another.

728
00:41:25,974 --> 00:41:28,209
Wonder who's going down next?

729
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:31,179
Everybody, if b. has anything to say about it.

730
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:33,181
You know you love me,

731
00:41:33,181 --> 00:41:35,583
X.o.x.o., gossip girl.
