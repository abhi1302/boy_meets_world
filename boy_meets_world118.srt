Judy--queen of zits.

this evening...

00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,448
So she'll spend all night...

00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,785
in the bathroom
squeezing her face...

Stumpy's Revenge.

I thought Stumpy died
in Part 5.

20
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,941
Well, that's why
he wants revenge.

21

00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,003
Yeah, but we can

fast forward over that.

36
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:24,169
All right, you're right.
It's a major scam.

gonna do the crime...

Why do you think
Mom and Dad...

are letting me go get
my driver's license...

with Jason and his brother
instead of with them?

Because they hope you'll
get lost and never come back?

44
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,657
No. Because they trust me.

45
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,250

I'd say this...

54
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,711

And maybe I can fit
into this master plan of yours.

00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:03,882
After you get your license...

57
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,612
we could drive downtown
and check out...

on Third Street.

go to the drive-thru...

a bucket of hot wings...

Hello, Eric.

00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:51,898
I was wondering
if you could help me out...

I don't even want to think about
what a crisis for her would be.

191

would have to pop.

Uh, anyway,
I'm going...

193
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,589

a replacement babysitter.

a time crunch, don't you?

to try on my new floppy hat?

00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:10,875
No, Morgan.

215
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,817
Now, here I really must
draw the line.

216
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,480
I will not put on
your floppy hat.

217

Now, that's not going to work.

218

We had an agreement.

219
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,923
I was to get dressed up
and come to your tea party.

220
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:30,834
And then you were to leave me
in complete peace...

221
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,838
so that I could
grade my papers.

222
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,306
Now, I have upheld
my part of the bargain.

00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,923
Upstairs. Now.

356
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:40,232
You, return

to your home...now.

357
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,571
Jason, you cannot leave me
holding the bag for all this.

358
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,701
Ha ha ha. See how
little you know me?

359
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,871
And as for you, young man,
I want you to go to your room...

360
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,679
and wait till
your parents return.

361
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,742
Just because you were once
my sixth grade teacher...

362
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,378
does not give you the right
to tell me what to do.

363
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,445
Go to your room!

364
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:57,854
Apparently it does.

365
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,288
I don't suppose
your parents have any Maalox...

366
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,229
in the house, do they?

367
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,333
What are you watching?

368
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,334
Uh...

369
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,335
uh...

370
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:14,328
it's caribou...migrating
and licking their babies.

371
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,342
Where's the remote?
Where's the remote?

372
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,844
MAN ON Tv:. ALL right.
fun-Loving stewardess...

373
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,176
coffee. tea...

374
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,681
or bazooka sheLL?

375
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,183
WOMAN ON Tv:.
Uh...coffee?

376
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:26,185
No!

377
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,447
[ExpLosion]

378
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,545
ooh!

379
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,850
[Screaming]

380
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:33,017
Why did that man
just blow up her head?

381
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,493
-Uh, it's nature.

-It's human nature.

382
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:38,793
A rich tapestry
of exploding heads.

383
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,299
[Screams and expLosions]

384
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,730
That is cheap garbage.

385
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,365
Wait. What are you doing?

386
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,138
No, Mr. Feeny.
our machine's kind of tricky.

387
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,146
No!

388
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,704
This is rated "R."

389
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,579
Yeah, "R" for wrecked.

390
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,813
Now Shawn's gonna
have to pay for it.

391
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,345
-Shawn?
-Hey, you rented it.

392
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,988
AMY: George.
you're not supposed to be here.

393
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:09,995
What's wrong?

394
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,795
The babysitter canceled.
I'm doing my best to fill in.

395
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,425
He killed our tape.

396
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:16,730
What tape?

397
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:17,827
Good move.

398
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,338
Uh, tape? There is no tape.

399
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,831
Did I say tape?
What was I thinking?

400
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,845
You were thinking...
"Good night, Shawn."

401
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,371
Shawn, you cannot leave me here
with this tape.

402
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,112
Heh. See how little you know me?

403
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:37,179
I'm BLowing Up
Your Head. Part 6?

404
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,123
From the little I saw--

405
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,955
Uh, no. No, thank you, George.

406
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,656
I think I can figure out
the subtle plot nuances.

407
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:48,428
You smuggled a violent
"R"-rated movie into this house?

408
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,991
oh, no, no, honey.
Calm down.

409
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,697
This may look like
a violent film...

410
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,137
but at its heart,

it's really a morality tale...

411
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,697
about an eleven-year-old boy...

412
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,335
who's in terrible, terrible,

terrible trouble.

413
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,402
Dad, it's just a tape.

414
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,914
It's trash.
I don't Want it in the house.

415
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,382
Go to your room, Cory.

416
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,509
For how long?

417
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,416
31 years.

418
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,751
Mom, I'm your son.

419
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,654
Cory, you're dog meat.

420
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,854
Uh, Mom, Dad.

421
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,625
Speaking of Puppy Chow...

422
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,393
Wait a minute.
You're not here.

423
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,298
My car isn't in the driveway.

424
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,271
You're out driving it somewhere
very, very carefully, right?

425
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,273
Uh, Dad, I hope
you're in a good mood.

426
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,535
You lose.

427
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:33,102
Ahem. Uh,

your car got towed away.

428
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:38,415
You are the worst babysitter
that ever lived.

429
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:42,854
And your children
are the spawn of Satan.

430
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,721
Honey, I think
you should stay calm.

431
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,225
I am calm.

432
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,717
Under the circumstances,

I'm the Dalai stinking Lama.

433
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,663
Eric, where is the car?

434
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:53,892
It's at the impound station.

435
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,491
I have the forty bucks
to bail it out.

436
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,297
Great, but I'll have

to drive you down there...

437
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,394
So we can get it home.

438
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,905
Actually, you both
will have to drive him.

439
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,134
Why?

440
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,632
Because one of you is gonna have
to drive Mom's car back...

441
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,612
and one of you is gonna
have to drive your car back.

442
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,773
Why?

443
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,476
He hasn't got
a driver's license.

444
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,145
Well...

445
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,676
my work is done.

446
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,824
I'll just leave.

447
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:19,950
Tip?

448
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,285
No?

449
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,693
Well, then, all right.

450
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,125
I, uh...

451
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,464
I sort of failed
my driving test.

452
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,369
But you still decided to...

453
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:33,895
sort of drive my car...

454
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,236
without a license.

455
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,799
Well, you're going
to get your license.

456
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,811
And then I'm going
to take it away.

457
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,643
You are gonna be a pedestrian
for life, pal.

458
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,910
Go to your room, Eric.

459
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,314
No, I'm not finished

with him yet.

460
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,545
I haven't started
with him yet.

461
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,610
But I want to talk
with you now.

462
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,645
Is my authority
being undermined?

463
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,885
Would I do that
in front of your son?

464
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,415
Go to your room.

465
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:01,293
-No good.
-What, no good?

466
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,766
Who drives Morgan
to gym class?

467
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,235
Who drives Cory
to little league?

468
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,794
Who drives Eric
on a tristate search...

469
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,897
for the perfect
flannel shirt? Me.

470
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,033
I take these kids everywhere.

471
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:11,703
I help...

472
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,444
when I can.

473
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,039
I mean Well.

474
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,553
I want Eric
to get his license.

475
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:25,284
I have been waiting for this
for sixteen years.

476
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,224
So how are we supposed
to punish him?

477
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,920
Look, Eric sees driving...

478
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,521
as nothing but dates
with cheerleaders...

479
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,191
open road, unlimited freedom.

480
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,063
But I am seeing
his driving...

481
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,535
as trips to the dry cleaners
and the supermarket...

482
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,197
and taking
his brother and sister...

483
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,069
wherever they want to go.

484
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:44,076
I never should've
tried to scam them.

485
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,078
Crime doesn't pay.

486
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:47,602
Violence is bad.

487
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,479
They're gonna kill me.

488
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:53,985
Cor, just be happy
it was a baby scam.

489
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,487
Mine, on the other hand,

was a megascam...

490
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,581
a hyperscam,
the mother of all scams.

491
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,990
I am truly a dead man.

492
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:05,087
These could be our last few
precious moments together.

493
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:07,622
Is there anything
you want to say to me?

494
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,702
Yeah.

495
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,670
Here's a lovely parting gift.

496
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:13,694
ooh!

497
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,374
-Cory...
-Eric...

498
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,379
Dad...

499
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,176
Mom...

500
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,308
I think you know why we're here.

501
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:28,320
And I think you know
why we're here.

502
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:31,551
This is the sentencing phase
of the proceedings.

503
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,490
I'm the oldest.
Do me first.

504
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:36,188
Both of you are grounded
for two weeks.

505
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:39,129
BoTH: Aah! Two weeks?
Grounded?

506
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:40,655
That's horrible!

507
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:43,198
There's more.

508
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,669
BOTH: There's more.

509
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,468
During those two weeks,
you will do nothing but study...

510
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,532
the Pennsylvania
Motor Vehicle handbook...

511
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,703
and you will pass
your driver's test.

512
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:53,712
I'll try.

513
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:54,906
You'll pass.

514
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,005
I'll pass.

515
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,573
And what will I do
for two weeks?

516
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,085
oh, you're going
to watch TV.

517
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,087
Cool.

518
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:05,090
Educational TV, and nothing but
educational TV...

519
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,684
starting right now.

520
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:10,991
MAN ON Tv:. The caribou
marks its territory...

521
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,864
by defecating
and flinging its dung.

522
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,424
Eww!.

523
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:27,808
Come on, I'll be

late for gymnastics.

524
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,338
Eric, come on. Little league
starts in twenty minutes...

525
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,145
and we have to stop
at the cleaners...

526
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,310
to pick up my uniform.

527
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,047
I want to stop
for frozen yogurt.

528
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,180
And we have to pick up Shawn
and we have to stop...

529
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:39,783
and get pizza
because you're the snack mom.

530
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,385
How shall I spend
my afternoon?

531
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,794
Should I read magazines
and then soak in the tub...

532
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,298
or should I soak
and then read?

533
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,301
Soak and read,

read and soak.

534
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:51,326
Hi, hon.

535
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,235
How was your day?

536
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:54,466
Ahh, bliss.

537
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,599
It's good to have
a son who drives.

538
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,940
-Little league!
-Frozen yogurt!

539
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,003
I'll drive off a bridge,
I swear I will.

540
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,310
