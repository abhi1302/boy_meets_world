1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:03,225
You got your milk.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,830
You got your peanut butter.

3
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:08,973
How about a banana?

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,910
What about a raw egg?

5
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,845
Eww. Why's it have to be raw?

6
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:15,849
Why can't we scramble it
and put it in?

7
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:18,545
Stallone drinks raw eggs.

8
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:21,019
Stallone is like 5'2"!

9
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,454
And you're like 2'5"!

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,084
Go with the egg, baby.

11
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:31,331
Hey!
We're not going to make a mess.

12
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,832
Just because
we're kids with a blender...

13
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,733
doesn't mean
we have to make a mess.

14
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,999
Boy, are you Mommy whipped.

15
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,506
Aah!

16
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,144
Now, that I could never do

at my house.

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,013
oh, my mom!
Shawn, back me up.

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,315
I wanted to use the lid.
I was Lid Boy!

19
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,692
oK, fine. I'll clean it up.

20
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,717
You don't have to scream.

21
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,591
Hey, watch it.

22
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,462
You're getting it
all over my geography book.

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,968
oh, like you're ever going
to open it up.

24
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,698
Feeny's test tomorrow
is going to be such a killer.

25
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,865
Yeah, I don't understand

why we have to learn...

26
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,169
anything about geography.

27
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,233
Why do we have to
learn where everything is?

28
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:21,338
I'll just be like my dad
and drive around till I find it.

29
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,610
Look at Feeny.

30
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,211
He's out there hanging up
some geeky duck.

31
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,983
Not a care in the World...

32
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:32,287
while we're stuck in here
studying for his lame test.

33
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,794
Yeah. Life's fair.

34
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,160
Well, we haven't actually done
any studying yet.

35
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,290
Maybe we should get started.

36
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,493
oK. Ahem.

37
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:43,503
What is
the capital of North Dakota?

38
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:44,731
Banff.

39
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,565
We're toast.

40
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,907
Let's just say we're sick
and stay home tomorrow.

41
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,104
I can't, Cor.

42
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,511
I've already used
all my bogus medical excuses.

43
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,812
Feeny says if my grandma dies
one more time...

44
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,512
he wants to see the body.

45
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,020
How come it has to be us?

46
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,453
Why should
we always be the ones...

47
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,821
faking a disease
to get out of school?

48
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:08,419
How come Feeny can't shoulder
a little more responsibility?

49
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,054
Ah, dream on.

I hear he hasn't missed...

50
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:13,157
a day of school
since World War l.

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,690
That's just stupid
on his part...

52
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,067
because teachers still get paid
when they're sick.

53
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:18,264
You lie.

54
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,637
I swear!
Minkus said the school board...

55
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,837
pays them to be sick
for a whole week every year.

56
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,345
Well, maybe
Feeny doesn't know that.

57
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,009
Maybe we should leave him
a unanimous note on his desk.

58
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,110
Won't help us dodge
that geography bullet tomorrow.

59
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,012
Come on...cough!

00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:38,991
[lnhales]

61
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,392
[Exhales]

62
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,001
There's a look.

63
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,367
Don't tell me.

64
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:53,771
You've died and come back
as a bat with a perm.

65
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,274
This Hindu yoga position...

66
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,208
increases
blood flow to the brain...

67
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:00,509
thus maximizing concentration
and cognitive performance.

68
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,744
It's also quite a rush.

69
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,251
I am so nervous.

70
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,344
You? My palms
are sweating so much...

71
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,787
I can't read the answers
I Wrote on them.

72
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:13,725
I'm sensing an acute case
of performance anxiety...

73
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,593
no doubt brought on by
a complete lack of preparation.

74
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,360
Minkus, you can get
all the As you want.

75
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,526
It still not
gonna make you popular.

76
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,728
That's right.

77
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:23,963
I can just hear you
10 years from now.

78
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,973
"People, people, how many times
do I have to tell you?

80
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,500
"you won't have to worry
about an audit."

81
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,537

ten years from now.

82
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,482
"Your Honor, dude...

83
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,712
"I'd like to plea bargain."

-Geek master.
-Recidivist.

85
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,989
Good morning, class.

86
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,929
I'm Miss Chase,

your substitute teacher.

87
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,125
Mr. Feeny will not be in today.

88
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,656
He has taken ill.

89
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,465
Taken ill or fakin' ill?

90
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:58,994
I mean,

the guy's never missed a day.

91
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,098
Maybe he heard about
the school board's...

92
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:03,769
great deal on sick leave.

93
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,507
I'm afraid I don't have access
to Mr. Feeny's lesson plan.

94
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:08,707
Can somebody
please fill me in...

95
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,080
on what you were going
to do today?

96
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,608
Miss Chase, today
we're supposed to take a geo--

97
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,917
Break.
A break from geography.

98
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,117
And do nothing
but think about our lives...

99
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,557
and write a poem about it.

100
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,060
A short poem.

101
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,527
CORY:
Two. maybe three Lines. tops.

102
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,463
And it doesn't
even have to rhyme.

103
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,830
Is this true?

104
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:29,901
Yep.

105
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,905
MlSS CHASE: Great.

106
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,465
My major at the University
of Pennsylvania...

107
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,843
was poetry...epic poetry.

108
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,249
In fact, my dissertation
was on "Beowulf"...

109
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,444
an 8th Century poem...

110
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,977
written in 3,200 lines

of old English.

111
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,353
Let's see
if We can knock out...

112
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,121
the first 1,600 lines

before lunch, shall we?

113
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,356
BOTH: Aah!

[Music playing]

115
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:01,416
I can't believe Mr. Feeny
actually missed a day of school.

116
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,123
Well, you know who you can
thank for that, don't you?

117
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:06,155
Zeus?

118
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,430
Me! I wished for him
to get sick, and he did.

119
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,528
You didn't wish for him
to get sick.

120
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,039
Sure, I did, yesterday,
when we weren't studying.

121
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,939
Even if you did,
you can't make...

122
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,206
something happen
just because you say it.

123
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,405
The power of the mind...

124
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,175
is not to be
taken lightly, Shawn.

125
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,945
Force of will is the most
powerful weapon on earth.

126
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,887
No. No, it's not.

127
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,252
Maybe I do have
some kind of strange power...

128

Iike the X-Men...

129
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,464
only I have the power
to make people sick.

130
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,469
Yeah.
It's working on me right now.

131
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:47,564
Maybe I'll call myself Sick Boy!

132
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,906
Sick Boy, possessor of
a strange mutant power...

133
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,912
can, with a glance
of his sickening eye...

134
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:55,380
make otherwise healthy men
bend over the toilet...

135
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,509
and go, "Huahh!"

136
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,018
All right, Sick Boy.

137
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:03,022
If you can do it, do it to him.

138
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,523
Piece of cake.

00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,582
Hey, Minkus.
Minkus, come here.

140
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,624
When your mother
cuts your hair...

141
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:12,791
tell her to take the oatmeal
out of the bowl.

142
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,562
Sorry, Shawn,
but I don't have the energy...

143
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,765
to trade insults today.
I'm not feeling very well.

-Whoa.
-Chills.

What can I say? It's a gift.

146
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,910
Minkus, you were all right
in class this morning.

147
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,746
When, exactly,
did you start feeling terrible?

148
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,617
When I heard
Mr. Feeny's in the hospital.

149
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,350
The hospital? Sounds serious.

150
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,381
For Mr. Feeny and for you.

151
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:42,293
Why me?
Why's it serious for me?

152
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:46,026

what goes around comes around.

The hospital?
Whoa, you are good.

154
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,702
Me? I didn't do this.

155
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,404
You wished he would get sick.

156
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,276
I didn't wish for him
to get sick.

157
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,043
Sure, you did, yesterday,
when we weren't studying.

158
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,051
Shawn, you said it yourself.

159
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,019
Just because you want
something to happen...

160
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,351
doesn't mean
it's going to happen.

161
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,289
You're scary, Cor.

162
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,690
I wish you wouldn't
say things like that.

163
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:16,924
Just don't look at me, oK?

Don't look at me!

164
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:23,525
"Free Bubba, Love, Arnie"?

165
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,869
"Feel better, Love, Amy."

166
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,875
oh, that's

what you think you wrote.

167
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,570
Cory, read this.

168
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:35,047
"Fried baloney, Love, Alvin."

169
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,777
-Just sign it!
-What is it?

170
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,717
It's a get well card
for Mr. Feeny.

171
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,220
Here, you sign it, too.

172
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,552
-I don't think so, Mom.

-Suit yourself.

173
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,252
I just wanted to get him
out of the hospital faster.

174
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,192
How's a card going to do that?

175
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:51,026
It cheers him up.
Power of positive thinking.

176
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,691
Wait a minute.
Mom, Mom, Mom.

177
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,791
You're saying
someone can get better...

178
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,563
just 'cause
someone wishes they will?

179
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:57,900
Yeah.

180
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,497
Does the opposite
of that work, too?

181
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,837
Can someone get sick...

182
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,502
just 'cause
someone says they will?

183
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:08,071
Well, that is the principle
behind voodoo curses.

184
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,776
But you'd have to go to,
like, a voodoo academy...

185
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,285
to pull off something like that,
wouldn't you?

186
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,617
I mean, your average
12-year-old on the street...

187
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,453
couldn't go around making people
drop like flies, could he?

188
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,627
No reason. No interest.

189
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:24,391
My lips are just moving.
Words are coming out.

190
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,163
CORY: Eric. we've got to taLk.

191
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,727
All right, I wished real hard
for Feeny to get sick...

192
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,966
so I wouldn't have to take
this geography test...

193
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,497
and he got sick.

194
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,567
-So?
-So, I did this to him.

195
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,237
I have the gift.

196
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,837
What gift?

197
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,041
I can make people sick.

198
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,550
Now, see,

I've always known that, Cor.

199
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,779
Why do you think
I sleep with a barf bag?

200
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,287
Eric, I'm serious.

201
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,721
Yeah, like you're the one
who made Feeny's appendix blow.

202
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:51,917
He has appendicitis?

203
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,391
Yeah, he's getting
operated on right now.

204
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,394
An operation. That's bad.

205
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,020
Remember Fluffy, our cat?

206
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,792
He died during an operation.

207
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,663
Cory, Fluffy fell out of a tree.

208
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,192
They were trying
to sew his head back on.

209
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,068
It was big odds going in.

210
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:16,572
Look, I know I did not cause

Mr. Feeny to get sick...

211
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,084
but it would make me
feel a heck of a lot better...

212
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,279
if you would just give me...

213
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,380
some sort of sign
that he's gonna be all right.

214
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,093
MISS CHASE: Yesterday we were
absoLuteLy enthraLLed...

215
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,869
by the first 1.600
exciting Lines of "Beowulf."

216
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,672
[Snoring]

217
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,235
Can anyone recap for us?

218
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,350
Hrothgar, king of the Danes,
on the island of Zealand...

219
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,479
has built the mead hall Heorot
for feasting his warriors...

220
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,853
but they abandon it
because of...

221
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,223
the murderous ravages
of the monster Grendel.

222
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,251
Is it just me,
or does anyone else...

223
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:05,731
want to absolutely hurl
from boredom?

224
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,393
Do you have
a problem with "Beowulf"?

225
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,528
Yeah.
My problem is nobody cares.

226
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:14,438
I don't need this.
When am I going to need this?

227
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,908
No one has ever needed this.

228
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,911
And let me make myself
even clearer.

229
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:20,674
"Beowulf" needed? No!

230
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,546
And on
a completely side issue...

231
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,746
who names their baby Hrothgar?

232
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,777
Are you through?

233
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,789
No. As a matter of fact,

I'm not.

234
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,848
I don't think
we need geography, either.

235
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,554
This is a school.
What we should do here?

236
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,291
I think we should sit around,

talk about whatever we want...

237
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:41,095
and you should make us cupcakes.

238
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:47,332
Cory Matthews,
you are so...right.

239
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,167
Shawn, Shawn, wake up!

240
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,610
I fixed everything.

241
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,705
Thank you for stopping me
from wasting my entire life.

242
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,182
I mean, I would have ended up
just like Mr. Feeny...

243
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,448
who believes in
geography and mathematics...

244
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,681
and that other garbage
you'll never need.

245
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,283
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a teacher!

246
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:09,693
Here. Why don't you pass
these out to everybody?

247
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,253
When did you bake these?

248
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,889
Just this second.

249
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,229
I most heartily object...

250
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,168
to this flagrant desecration
of the temple of knowledge.

251
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,194
Stuff it, nerd boy.

252
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,242
Mr. Matthews,

who's the new teacher?

253
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,611
Karen.

254
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:29,910
Karen?

255
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,009
Yeah.
We're on a first name basis.

256
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,447
Cozy.

257
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,956
And we're not taking
that geography test, either.

258
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,323
In fact, we've done away
with geography.

259
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,520
No one needs it.

260
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,394
You must think
you've died and gone to heaven.

261
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,591
Yep. No offense,
but you could learn...

262
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:49,864
a lot about teaching
from Karen.

263
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,632
Well, I guess I've been an ogre
all these years, hmm?

264
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:53,832
What was I thinking?

265
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,306
Nobody knows.

266
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,241
But all that stress
you put on us...

267
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,609
probably just bounced back
and made you sick.

268
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:05,050
Karma--what goes around
goes around and around.

269
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:10,980
You need to lighten up.

270
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,549
Well, thank you for the advice,
Mr. Matthews.

271
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:16,027
Uh...Iike this?

272
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,627
Cut it out, Cory.

273
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,966
That wasn't me.
That was Mr. Feeny.

274
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:28,064
Mr. Feeny?
Talk about a sick joke.

275
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,667
What do you mean?
He's standing right here.

276
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,611
oh, nurse!

277
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,511
He can't see me, Mr. Matthews.

278
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,913
Why not?

279
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,577
Because he's not the one
responsible.

280
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,519
Responsible for What?

281
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,021
For killing me.

282
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,717
I died in the hospital.

283
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,917
What?

284
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,585
I'm dead, Mr. Matthews...

285
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,891
thanks to you.

286
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:54,694
Don't die, Mr. Feeny!
I didn't mean to kill you!

287
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,497
oh, man.

288
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:59,369
Eric, I just dreamed
I killed Mr. Feeny...

289
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,872
and he came back to haunt me.

290
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,671
It Was terrible. Eric?

291
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,904
Aah!

292
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,311
What are you doing here?

293
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,682
I'm memorizing the dictionary,
Mr. Matthews.

294
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:16,155
Mr. Feeny, I just woke up.
You can't be here anymore.

295
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,625
I can be anywhere I want.
I'm dead.

296
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,119
You're not dead.
You can't be dead.

297
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,393
I only wanted you
to have the sniffles.

298
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,957
It started With the sniffles.

299
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,832
[Sniffs]

300
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,186
Cor, you look terrible.

301
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,711
Coffee?

302
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:55,620
What are you doing with coffee?

303
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:59,791
I always drink coffee
after I kill a man.

304
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:03,427
Mr. Feeny's in the hospital
because of a bad appendix.

305
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,131
No matter what you wished,
you had nothing to do with it.

306
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,538
But how come I can't get him
out of my mind?

307
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,166
Why am I seeing him everywhere?

308
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,676
Because you feel guilty.

309
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,906
Because I wished he'd get sick.

310
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,345
Yeah, why'd you do that?

311
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,214
So I wouldn't have to take
his stupid geography test...

312
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,718
about stuff I'd never need.

313
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,720
Yeah, I know how you feel.

314
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,212
I had a teacher
in fourth grade--Miss Perch.

315
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,886
Now, the name Perch implies
that she was...

316
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,328
a lot better-looking
than she actually was.

317
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:34,299
And this relates to me how?

318
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,733
You know why I'm the manager
down at the supermarket?

319
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,703
Because when I started out
as a box boy...

320
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,400
I could add long columns
of numbers in my head...

321
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,342
faster than the cashiers
could at the machines.

322
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,368
I always told everyone
it was a natural gift...

323
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,540
but the fact is, I knew

it was a gift from Miss Perch.

324
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,743
So, why did you feel guilty?

325
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,151
Well, when she was trying
to teach me math...

326
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,678
I Was the kid
in the back of the room...

327
00:15:56,722 --> 00:16:02,752
always going,
"I'm never gonna need this."

328
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,696
By the time I figured out
why I needed it...

329
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,165
it was too late to say
thank you.

330
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:11,329
So you're saying
Feeny's teaching us stuff now...

331
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,201
that we're gonna need
when we're older.

332
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:16,697
And instead of saying thank you,
I wished for him to get sick.

333
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,505
Is that why
I'm having nightmares?

334
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,980
Your nightmares are just
a manifestation of your guilt.

335
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,574
You created them.
You can control them.

336
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:31,379
MR. FEENY: What's for
breakfast. Mr. Matthews?

337
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,256
Down here.

338
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,659
How you doing?

339
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,596
You don't scare me anymore,
Mr. Feeny.

340
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,098
You're not real.

341
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,930
You're just
a manifestation of my guilt.

342
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:45,164
ooh. "Manifestation."

343
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,901
Big word for someone
who can barely spell "cat."

344
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:52,274
I created him.
I can make him go away.

345
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,675
Whew.

346
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:03,188
[Laughing]

347
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,106
[Knock knock]

348
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,273
Knock knock.

349
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,715
Mr. Matthews.

350
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,878
What a surprise.

351
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,547
Where are your parents?

352
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:38,489
They didn't bring me.
I took the bus.

353
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:42,324
Actually,
they don't even know I'm here.

354
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,330
I brought you a germanium.

355
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,128
Geranium.

356
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,158
Didn't I say germanium?

357
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,669
Yes, you did.

358
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:55,140
In fact, germanium
is a chemical element.

359
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,507
Atomic weight--72.59.

360
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,944
It's used as a semiconductor.

361
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,711
Your brain must weigh so much.

362
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,083
A geranium is a lovely plant.

363
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:13,552
In California, they can grow
to the size of a bush.

364
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:19,424
So...this is a hospital, huh?

365
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,434
oh. Is this your grandson?

366
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,265
-No.
-No way.

367
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,861
-Not at all.
-What he said.

368
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:28,373
This is one of my students
Cory Matthews.

369
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,534
Cory, this is Nurse Jill.

370
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,635
Well, it's nice to see

one of your students...

371
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,373
came to visit you, George.

372
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,779
She calls you
by your first name?

373
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,046
Don't blow it for me,

you little weasel.

374
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:40,575
[Laughs]

375
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,748
I stashed two bottles of
that pineapple juice you like...

376
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,349
in case you and your nongrandson
want to have one.

377
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,825
I am eternally grateful.

378
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,829
Cory, you stay
as long as you like.

379
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,832
And if a big dragon in a hat
that says "Head Nurse"...

380
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,333
tries to kick you out...

381
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,337
you tell her
you're a friend of Jill's, oK?

382
00:18:58,371 --> 00:18:59,838
oK.

383
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,965
See you later, George.

384
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,602
She seems nice.

385
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,408
Yes, indeed. Very nice.

386
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:13,418
Did we just have,
like, a guy moment?

387
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,012
Yes, I suppose we did.

388
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:19,024
Why are you here, Mr. Matthews?

389
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,993
I mean, a hospital
is a very scary place.

390
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:25,759
I guess I wanted to see
with my own eyes that you're oK.

391
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,925
Thank you
for your good thoughts.

392
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,161
And that you're not dead.

393
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,669
oh, I can't die, Mr. Matthews.

394
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:34,195
I have too much Work
left undone...

395
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,073
too many students left untaught.

396
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:40,169
-Like me?
-Especially you.

397
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:44,774
In a strange way,
you've kept me alive.

398
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,114
I'm glad.

399
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,382
Because there
still might be some stuff...

400
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:51,117
you're going to teach me
that I'm gonna need someday.

401
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,317
Like What?

402
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,848
Like, say
I'm walking down the street...

403
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,952
and some guy
comes up to me and says...

404
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:58,259
"What's the atomic weight
of geranium?"

405
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,787
Thanks to you,
I'll be able to say...

406
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,493
"That's a plant, you idiot."

407
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,263
[Laughs]

408
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,567
Dragon alert. Lay low.

409
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,369
Maybe I'd better go so I don't
get Nurse Jill in trouble.

410
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,876
Thank you very much for coming,
Mr. Matthews.

411
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,243
You've made me feel much better.

412
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,271
I feel better, too.

413
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,283
Mr. Feeny...

414
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,849
Thank you.

415
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,481
For What?

416
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:28,118
I don't know yet.

417
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,639
Hey, Cor, what are you doing?

418
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,876
I'm trying to fix
Mr. Feeny's dumb duck.

419
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,008
He's coming home tomorrow.

420
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,849
That's nice. Looks like
it could use some bracing.

421
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:57,879
Bracing, right.
Can I borrow your tools?

422
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,117
Sure.

423
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,696
Good morning, Mr. Matthews.

424
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,892
Mr. Feeny, you're home early.

425
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,733
Well, I got most
of my strength back.

426
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:15,263
Besides, they replaced
Nurse Jill with Nurse Larry.

427
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,701
I figured it was time to leave.

428
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,915
I'm trying to fix your duck.

429
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,746
Yes, so I see. Thank you.

430
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:30,415
Why don't you take a break
and help me plant this?

431
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,584
You're putting my puny plant
in the ground?

432
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:37,221
Your plant, though immature
and undeveloped...

433
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:43,429
has within it the potential
to grow and flower...

434
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,664
with the help
of a proper gardener.

435
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,296
You think so?

436
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:52,333
oh, yes, as long as no one
wishes it ill.

437
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,792
IfWe think it can happen,
it Will happen.

438
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,263
You're saying we can light
that light bulb...

439
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:13,788
without any electricity?

440
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,893
The greatest power company
of all is the human mind.

441
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:20,099
Apparently
Shawn didn't pay his bill.

442
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:22,107
Those are cute last Words.

443
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,472
Shh.

444
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,172
Let's focus our psychic energies
on lighting the bulb.

445
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:29,044
There's no place like home.

446
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,049
There's no place like home.

447
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,277
Quiet.

448
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,712
None of the electricity
made it to the bulb, Topanga.

449
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,621
It all got stuck in your hair.

450
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,455
There's your problem.

451
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,961
No one here
is taking this seriously.

452
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:46,624
They don't care about
your experiment, Topanga.

453
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,132
The only way to demonstrate...

454
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:50,032
the power of
their selfish minds...

455
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,730
is to have them
concentrate on something...

456
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,465
they really want to see happen.

457
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:02,240
BOTH: Cool!

458
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:05,739
What?
The bulb didn't lightമഊ㤊㤹ഹ《㨰〰〺㔬〰ⴠ㸭〠㨰〰㈺〬ര㰊潦瑮挠汯牯∽昣晦て∰猠穩㵥㐱眾睷琮獶扵楴汴獥渮瑥⼼潦瑮ാ
