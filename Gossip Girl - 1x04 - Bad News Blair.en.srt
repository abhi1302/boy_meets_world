1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,690
good morning, upper east siders.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,990
Gossip
girl here--

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,190
your one and only source into the
scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:08,990
oh, my god.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,690
You'll never believe
what's on "gossip girl.

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,790
" Someone saw serena getting
offthe train at grand central.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,290
I thought everythingwas good between us.

8
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,090
It was...before I found out
you had sex with my boyfriend.

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,290
I didn't come back for you.

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,890
Look, blair's my best
friend,and you're her boyfriend.

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,890
And she loves you.

12
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,390
You'd really go outwith
some guy you don't know?

13
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,990
Well, you can't be
worsethan the guys i do know.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,890
Well, our kids were bound
to meet.It's a small island.

15
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,090
Are you sure it's not some ploy,

16
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,990
your using my daughterto get to
me now that your wife left you?

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,390
Do you ever feel like our whole
lives have beenplanned out for us,

18
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,590
that we're just gonna
end up like our parents?

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,690
Man, that's a dark thought.

20
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,990
Your mother and I didn'twork this hard so
you can just make things upas you go along.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,590
it's a facilityfor the
disturbed or addicted.

22
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,890
The question is, what do you do now?

23
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,890
I was thinking...

24
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,690
total social destruction?

25
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,190
And here I thought
you were getting soft.

26
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,190
It's becauseof their excellent program

27
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,190
that a student here with
ustoday is clean and sober...

28
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,090
at least, for now.

29
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,090
She's in rehab?

30
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,890
No, it's not her.It's
her brother who's there.

31
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,990
I know I said some thingsabout
you and your world, and I'm sorry.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,790
Why did you leavewithout
saying good-bye?

33
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,690
I didn't know how to beyour
friend after what I did.

34
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,290
I'm so sorry.

35
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,790
Spotted in central park--
two white flags waving.

36
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,890
So what will it be--
truce or consequences?

40
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,590
sorry, but you're not on the list.

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,290
Of course I am.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,290
This is my dream!

43
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,290
not anymore.

44
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,690
oh, serena, it's so
wonderful to see you.

45
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,290
hey, upper east siders.

46
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,390
There's nothing gossip girl
likes more than a surprise,

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,390
and we hear blair waldorf's
got a 2-for-1 special--

48
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,290
her mom eleanor, who
just returned from paris,

49
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,790
and serena van der
woodsen, brunch buddies.

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,090
Hey!You're up.

51
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,990
Did we have plans?

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,990
Darling, it is impolite to interrupt.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,590
I was just telling serena that bendel's
is interested in carrying my line.

54
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,590
Really?

55
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,590
Oh, that's fantastic!

56
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,790
Why didn't you say something?

57
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,490
I came back from paris early
to put together my lookbook,

58
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,690
and if they like what they see,

59
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,290
it could be the beginning of
an entire lifestyle collection.

60
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,290
Because more people
should be like you, mother.

61
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,290
Before you tuck into that, you find
a low-fat yogurt more appealing.

62
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,790
I lost 2 pounds when you were away.

63
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,490
And you look marvelous.

64
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,690
Wow, these are beautiful, mrs.Waldorf.

65
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,390
Well, they will be if they're
not all squished from traveling.

66
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,990
Darling, please.

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,990
Serena, you have to come back
later when everything is unpacked.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,990
I would love to hear your thoughts.You
do have such great personal style.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,290
Oh, thank you, but i don't
think we'll be able to.

70
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,890
Blair and I have plans today.

71
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,490
We do?

72
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,490
Serena and blair might
have plans for the day,

73
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,390
but nate and chuck are fully
booked for the weekend...

74
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,890
if they survive it.

75
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,490
- Found it.
- Piaget.

76
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,490
Can't you just call it a watch?

77
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,690
If it costs more than 10
grand, it earns a proper name.

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,990
How about this?

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,490
Definitely that.

80
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,790
Babe ruth's called shot-- the
most famous homer he ever hit.

81
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,290
Better safe than sorry.

82
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,390
here we go.

83
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,490
you've lived through ivy week and hopefully
gained entry to the college of your choice.

84
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,690
Now let's ruin those chances.

85
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,390
Let me remind
you of the rules--

86
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,590
as of this moment, there is no
outside world that I do not show you.

87
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,290
You eat what I provide,
practice what I preach,

88
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,290
and till I say so,

89
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,890
the only girls you talk to
are the ones I've paid for.

90
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,500
Yeah!

91
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,390
Let the lost weekend commence!

92
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,590
one, two, three, twins!

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,890
who brought the sasquatch?

94
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,190
Isn't that carter baizen?

95
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,690
I haven't seen him since he was a
senior and we were in the eighth grade.

96
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,390
He looks intense.

97
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,390
Are you high?

98
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,090
He looks like matthew
mcconaughey between movies.

99
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,190
The guy's a loser.

100
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,490
Look, anyone who trades theirtrust fund
for a fanny pack flies in the face of all

101
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,990
that is holy to chuck bass.

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,090
Nate archibald,is that you?

103
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,690
Baizen, my man!I heard you went rogue!

104
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,290
- and lived to tell about it.
- Hey.

105
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,090
Seems like someone's itinerary
didn't leave room for interlopers.

106
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,390
Doesn't chuck know a party isn't
a party until someone crashes?

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,790
oh, god.

108
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,390
I forgot whatit was like to be with you.

109
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,490
No, they were looking at both of us.

110
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,490
Don't insult me.

111
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,890
It's beenlike this all morning, starting
with your lovely visitwith my mother.

112
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,790
She didn't even call me to
tell me she was coming home.

113
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,890
Well, she was busy.

114
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,690
She was rushing to get homeand
everything because she wanted to see you.

115
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,890
She didn't even wake me up.

116
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,590
Well, you know how
eleanorfeels about beauty rest.

117
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,990
She likes you more than me.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,690
She does not.You are her daughter.

119
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,590
She doesn't like anyonemore
than you.She just...

120
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,490
I don't know, doesn't
knowhow to show it sometimes.

121
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,990
Okay, I'm going inside.Wait
for me.I'll be right back.

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,190
Humphrey!Dan!Hey!

123
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,790
Hey!

124
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,190
oh, my god, this iswhat
I love about this city--

125
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,190
you're alwaysbumping into people.

126
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,490
What are you doing here?

127
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,390
Oh, I'm just on my wayback from my
mom's, dropping jenny offup in hudson.

128
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,390
Picked up a couple of
cubansfor me and my dad...

129
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,490
sandwiches, not cigars.

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,290
hey, uh, remember you said, uh,we could
get together sometime and, um, not talk?

131
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,390
I was just wondering,is
it "sometime" yet?

132
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,990
That was disgusting.The
D.O.H.Should shut them down.

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,290
- The bathroom?
- No, the people.

134
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,890
It's callednolita, not noshowers.

135
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,490
What are you doing here?

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,790
Do I smell pork?

137
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,790
And cheese?

138
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,390
Okay, well, when you're
donewith your charity work,

139
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,990
why don't you come find me?

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,390
I'll be at tory burchlooking at ponchos.

141
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,990
Isn't that the girlthat
told the entire school--

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,390
and, oh, several colleges--that
you had a drug problem?

143
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,190
Yeah.

144
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,690
but, you know,blair can be a little...

145
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,890
- blair.
- Yeah, yeah.

146
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,790
we're actuallytrying to work things out.

147
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,190
Today's our first dayhanging
out together alone.

148
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,790
so I shouldprobably get back.

149
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,390
- Yeah.Yeah, sure.That'S...
- yeah.

150
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,290
But, um, call me sometimeso
we can get together

151
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,590
and do that thingyou
didn't ask me to do.

152
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,690
so I don't understand.The
last timeI saw your sister,

153
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,490
she said your familyhad locked you out

154
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,290
and you'd fallen off
the face of the earth.

155
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,590
I didn'T.I just fell
offthe face of theirs.

156
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,490
But once you turn awayfrom money
you see it doesn't buy you freedom,

157
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,590
it pays for your prison.

158
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,290
They say I disappeared,
but all I did was break out.

159
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,790
- Where'd you go?
- Where didn't I?

160
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,290
I aided the cleanup post-katrina,
spent a yearrebuilding machu picchu--

161
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,690
which, let me tell
you,it's changed my life.

162
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,490
I bought an H.D.Cam and started
filming it for a documentary--

163
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,890
you're the guywho gave us our first
joint, snuck us into our first club,

164
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,690
and you're gonna tell me the life of
youtube filmmakeris better than this?

165
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,590
You invented the lost weekend.

166
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,990
Hey, who cares about a partywhen
you can travel the world?

167
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,690
exactly.

168
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,490
In the real world,the only thing that
matters is who you are,not what you own.

169
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,890
As muchas I love the speech
about not needingmaterial things

170
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,690
from a guy who hasthat
much product in his hair,

171
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,690
this party is about
excess,not exposition.

172
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,190
Stop talking.

173
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,990
Start partying.

174
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,190
Now here is somethingthat
doesn't need material.

175
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,590
As a matter of fact,it's
about to come off.

176
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,190
Who's with me?

177
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,690
I think I'm just
gonnahang here for a bit.

178
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,490
Fine.

179
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,090
I'd hate to break upa
matched set anyway.

180
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,390
how about we continue
thisover some cards?

181
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,190
None of this crapthese kids are playing.

182
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,690
Texas hold'em is dead.

183
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,290
you know, I'll show yousome real action.

184
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,990
You know what?

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,890
I'm in this weekly gamein
this, uh, corner in queens.

186
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,890
It goes all night.

187
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,890
It's the real deal--high
stakes, big money,

188
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,690
people with the kind of
storiesthat would put mine to shame.

189
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,690
You should--you
should come.

190
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,390
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

191
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,690
this one missedher cue at the chlo?show
because she was throwing up a pear.

192
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,790
ugh.She was invera's "vogue" spread.

193
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,290
I don't use vera's models.

194
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,190
None of these are right.

195
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,390
Well, that's because you're
looking atthe high fashion book

196
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,890
when you should
belooking for a new face--

197
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,590
you know, someone wholooks
good in your clothes.

198
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,790
Someone in this book, like I told you.

199
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,790
I hate the american appareleffect.

200
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,290
But they're closerto what you need.

201
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,090
They're--they're
now,they're hip.

202
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,790
If this person is supposedto represent
waldorf designs, you have to find mesomeone...

203
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,790
worthy of the clothes.

204
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,190
Someone like me.

205
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,190
Someone like...

206
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,090
my daughter.

207
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,590
Well, why not her?

208
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,990
You want your line to
representthe waldorf lifestyle.

209
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,790
Who better to represent you
than one of your own family?

210
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,790
She was my first dress form.

211
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,690
She'd love to!

212
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,990
I would?

213
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,890
Eleanor?

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,290
Yes.

215
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,390
it's perfect.

216
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,590
Eleanor waldorf, meet the new
faceof waldorf for bendel'S.

217
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,190
Yay!

218
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,890
is that a smile we see on B.'S lips?

219
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,490
The spotlight'son her for once,
and S.Actually helped her get it.

220
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,290
I guess miracles can happen.

221
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,890
It's gonna be so hot.

222
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,590
The clothes are gorgeous.

223
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,990
They're all right.

224
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,390
Oh, shut up.They're amazing.

225
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,090
I'm justdoing my mom a favor.

226
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,890
The hair and makeup testis tonight.

227
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,690
I think this is my best pose.

228
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,190
that's because youcan't
see what you look like.

229
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,590
You're just a hand model,and that's it.

230
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,390
The right way is this.

231
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,190
Girls, no.This is how you do it.

232
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,590
No, no, no.

233
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,290
Gotta curve your spine
forward, elongate.

234
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,490
Oh, no.You guysare doing it all wrong.

235
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,990
- Look, you're missing the key.
- Show us.

236
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,790
Look, look, look.You gottaput
the hand on the hip and pop.

237
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,490
That's how you gotta do it.

238
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,990
- pop.Pop.
- No, like this.

239
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,890
hello?

240
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,890
Uh-huh, who's this?

241
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,190
Oh!

242
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,490
Who'd dare interrupt the van
der woodsen as she teaches?

243
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,490
I said, "who?" Give me my phone!

244
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,890
- Dan humphrey.
- Who is it?

245
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,990
I'm sorry.The number you'vedialed
is no longer in service.

246
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,790
Stop it!who is it?

247
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,990
I'm doing you a favor.

248
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,290
Look, I can hear you.Can
ijust please talk to serena?

249
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,990
Apparently,you can, cabbage patch.

250
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,290
- Come on.Let me have it.
- god.

251
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,390
Hello?Dan!Hey.

252
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,090
I'm so, so sorry about that.

253
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,590
And I'm so, so readyto hang up.

254
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,790
Blair was just playing.

255
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,490
You havemy full attention, I promise.

256
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,590
Good, 'cause I was calling to ask you
to not talk with me at a movie tonight.

257
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,990
TonightWhere?What time?

258
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,990
The sunshine, 7:00.

259
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,790
I'd love to.

260
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,490
Uh, I'll see you there.

261
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,990
See you there.

262
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,190
It's complicated, isn't it?

263
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,690
I can't stop staring at it.

264
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,190
It's difficult work.

265
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,190
I mean that in the best way.

266
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,890
It's enigmatic.

267
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,790
It reminds me ofan
early bacon or schnabel.

268
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,690
The artist is in hudson.

269
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,490
I've represented herfor some...

270
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,390
time.

271
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,290
Rufus.

272
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,490
Bex simon.

273
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,090
I've heard a lotabout your gallery.

274
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,290
I wasn't expecting a piece
likethis from a former rock star.

275
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,090
I prefer"one-hit wonder.

276
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,290
" what turned you gallerist?

277
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,090
I've always hadartistic pursuits.

278
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,690
We have something in common.

279
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,290
I always pursue artists.

280
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,290
I've been in brooklyn all
daylooking for work for a client.

281
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,590
I'm a buyer.

282
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,390
I didn't thinkI'd find a piece like
this, and I don't thinkit'll be here long.

283
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,490
I'd to put it on hold.

284
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,690
May I?

285
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,390
Yeah, of course.

286
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,690
What time do you close?

287
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,490
I'll stay open.

288
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,690
Good.

289
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,690
thank you.

290
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,590
what is carterstill doing here?

291
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,890
I invited him.

292
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,490
Or he invited himself?

293
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,690
That is his style.

294
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,690
Begging us to break freeof our prisons

295
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,590
while stuffing his face with
free foodand draining our booze.

296
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,890
He's a deadbeatand a hypocrite.

297
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,390
And a good ballplayer,if
I remember right.

298
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,390
You sure you just don't
wannalose to him there, chuck?

299
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,890
Maybe if your d...bought you a
basketball team instead of a hotel,

300
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,390
you'd have some skill.

301
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,990
Look, this isthe lost weekend
for juniors, not senior citizens.

302
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,090
Go jump into a volcano.

303
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,390
Let's just settle it on the court.

304
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,190
Let's settle it right now.

305
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,390
Hey, chill out.

306
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,190
No, this is my game.I pick the players.

307
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,890
I get it.I'll go.

308
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,090
Hey.Hey, man.

309
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,290
- Is that card gametonight?
- Yeah.

310
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,890
- Hey, text methe address later.
- I will.

311
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,490
You didn't have to do that, man.

312
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,690
Nobody wanted him here.

313
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,690
He's an older
brotherbringing everyone down.

314
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,290
Let's just play some ball.

315
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,590
okay, blair, relax.Chin
down.Hold it there and...

316
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,190
okay, you ready?

317
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,590
okay, one more.This time, let's exhale.

318
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,690
Jump around, loosen up.

319
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,290
Now really loosen up on
this one.Let's relax into it.

320
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,690
Now give methe biggest pose you've got.

321
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,490
That's it.Come on, big!Let's
think big, big, big.

322
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,990
One, two, three!

323
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,590
okay, take a break.Thank you very much.

324
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,490
Who chose this girl?

325
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,690
Eleanor.Why?

326
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,190
She's so prim and stiff,like
a bookcase.It's unnatural.

327
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,190
Yeah, but she looks stunning
in the clothes, don't you agree?

328
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,790
Mm-hmm, to my eye,like a goddess.

329
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,590
To this eye?Bleh.like a statue.

330
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,790
This is retail.It's not editorial.She
needs to let go,have fun, loosen up.

331
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,290
How's the clientgoing to like the dress
if the modeldoesn't even like herself?

332
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,490
hey!

333
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,190
First of all,you look amazing!

334
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,490
I know.

335
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,290
but look,can I give you a little tip?

336
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,490
How did I know this was coming?

337
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,690
No, no, look,all you need
to do is maybe you could,

338
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,590
uh,loosen up a little, you know?

339
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,190
shake it out.

340
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,090
Um, maybe you could be
goofy,like when we were 10

341
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,490
and we would dance aroundto "genie
in a bottle" in your mom's clothes.

342
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,590
Help me.Help me.

343
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,790

00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,290
Come on, give me more,give

361
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,690
Oh, it looks so good!

362
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,690
You're doing so good!You got it!

363
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,390
look how good you are.

364
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,190
- Pout, pout, pout.

365
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,390
oh, shoot.I gotta go meet dan.

366
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,390
No, you're staying here.I need you.

367
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,490
I can't let my mother down.

368
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,090
hey, you almost here?

369
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,090
Hey,I'm really, really, sorry,

370
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,990
but I'm kind of stuckat
this photo shoot with blair.

371
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,190
It's a long story, but I don't
think I'm gonna be able to make it.

372
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,590
Oh, a photo shoot, huh?

373
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,290
It sounds really superficial,I know.

374
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,690
But it's important to her and,
you know,she's important to me.

375
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,290
But I'll make it up to
you, though, I promise.

376
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,890
No, it's no big deal,
really.Don't worry about it.

377
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,690
You're the best.

378
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,790
I knew you'd understand.

379
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,590
I'll call you later.

380
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,090
Yeah, yeah.

381
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,590
how many?

382
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,590
none.

383
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,590
You're still here.

384
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,790
Yeah, I told you I'd wait.

385
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,690
Mm, a man who keeps his word.

386
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,090
I like it.

387
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,190
You get a chanceto talk to your client?

388
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,790
I'm back, aren't I?

389
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,790
- Write me up an invoice.
- Really?

390
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,790
That's great.

391
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,590
Well,you're awfully excited.

392
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,690
This isn't your first time,is it?

393
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,890
Selling a painting.

394
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,490
few firstsare left for me.

395
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,590
But the artistwill be very pleased.

396
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,490
She'S...

397
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,590
been doingother things for a while.

398
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,690
It's kind of a big dealfor her.

399
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,790
Well, for my client, too.

400
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,590
This is a very special piece.

401
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,290
You wouldn't want to...

402
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,590
I don't know--celebrate
with a drink?

403
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,090
actually, the previouslymentioned
excited artist is my wife.

404
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,090
I thought you said the
artistlived in hudson.

405
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,590
Long commute.

406
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,190
She lives there.

407
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,190
I don'T.

408
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,290
If the trains everstop running...

409
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,190
phase
three--pub crawl.

410
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,590
Five boroughs.

411
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,890
50 pubs...

412
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,790
500 chances to get laid.

413
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,090
And remember,don't dip your
shillelagh...in the wrong pot of gold.

414
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,190
let's go.You can think
aboutyour boyfriend inside.

415
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,190
I'm not coming.

416
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,590
seriously,carter baizen sucks.

417
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,890
All right, I don't knowwhat spell he's
put you under, but he's not your friend.

418
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,890
He can't be trusted.

419
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,590
And why is that?

420
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,390
'Cause he doesn't
believewhat you believe in?

421
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,790
It's exactly what he said-- the
money, the drugs,the privileges.

422
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,490
They're just keeping
us numbso we don't know

423
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,890
it's--it's better out
therein the real world.

424
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,290
The real world?Everyoneout
there wants to be us.

425
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,290
We are what you aspire
to, not run away from.

426
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,690
You really don't get me,do you?

427
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,990
That dream of yours,you
know, what is it, really?

428
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,190
'Cause I hear you talk about how
you don't wantto go to dartmouth

429
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,190
and how you don't want to
followin your father's footsteps,

430
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,690
but what exactly do you want?

431
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,890
All I know isit's not this.

432
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,490
Well, you better discoverwhat "it" is

433
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,290
before you throw everything
awaytrying to find it.

434
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,790
And where are you going?

435
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,690
how was the movie?

436
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,190
Uh, missable...

437
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,190
literally.

438
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,790
I-I don't knowabout serena, dad.

439
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,490
I-I can't tellif she's worth it.

440
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,090
What do you mean?

441
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,790
Well, uh, she's best friendswith
this girl--blair waldorf--

442
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,590
who is basically everythingI
hate about the upper east side

443
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,690
distilled into one
95-pound,doe-eyed, bon mot tossing,

444
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,890
label-whoringpackage of girlie evil.

445
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,590
- no one's that bad.
- She is.

446
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,990
I would barely be exaggeratingif I told
you medusa wantsher withering glare back.

447
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,190
Well, if there's anythingI've
learned it's that usually

448
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,790
there'ssomething beneath the
surface with people like that

449
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,390
to make them act the way they do.

450
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,890
Like what-- the O.J.In her mimosa was
fromconcentrate, not fresh-squeezed?

451
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,590
And--and what does this sayabout
serena, that this isher best friend?

452
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,790
I dateda girl like serena once--
actually, a lot like serena.

453
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,190
And girls like thatare
challenging.It's true.

454
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,190
They're complicated and...

455
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,690
enigmatic...

456
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,690
and usually worth it.

457
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,990
And the only wayyou'll know for
sure is to jump in with both feet.

458
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,390
What happened with you?

459
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,090
I swam for a while...

460
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,090
till I drowned.

461
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,990
Well, that--thanks.That's
a great story, dad.

462
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,190
Now get some sleep, and I
will see youin the morning.

463
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,090
We'll goto the photo shoot together.

464
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,290
You haven't done thissince I was little.

465
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,090
You haven't been in bed by
10:00since you were little.

466
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,390
You looked beautiful tonight,you know?

467
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,290
Really?

468
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,290
hello?

469
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,590
How was the movie?

470
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,190
Did I misssomething amazing?

471
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,290
Well...

472
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,690
well, uh,even without the movie.

473
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,190
Don't be cocky.

474
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,990
I'm calling youwith a makeup plan.

475
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,890
- Oh, are you now?
- I am.

476
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,390
How would you like to seewhat
really happens at a fashion shoot?

477
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,890
I'm sorry.This is--this
is dan humphrey.

478
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,490
Are you sure you're
nottrying to reach my sister?

479
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,490
Look, I know it's a girlieoffer,
but chew on this-- I'll be there.

480
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,090
Can I bet on that?

481
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,390
Because law of averagessays
I lose my shirt.

482
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,590
Oh, come on.It's blair's shoot, so
I have to be there for moral support.

483
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,990
Blair?Well,I'm definitely not going now.

484
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,990
Look, she's reallynot
as bad as you think.

485
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,990
Besides, she's gonna beso busy with the
shoot that you won't evenhave to see her,

486
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,790
and since it's so
boringon the sidelines,

487
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,790
you'll havemy full attention.

488
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,290
Okay, what if I buy you
anythingyou want from craft service?

489
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,990
I thought craft service was free.

490
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,690
I'll see you in the morningat
8:00.I'm texting you the address.

491
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,090
I'm hanging upbefore
thou dost protest again.

492
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,790
both feet, humphrey.

493
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,290
what's the emergency apartfrom my not
getting my sleep before the big day,

494
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,890
laurel, and why couldn't we simply
havediscussed it over the phone?

495
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,490
Because if we didn'tmeet in
person, I couldn't show you these.

496
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,690
I don't think this girl
iswhat you're trying to say--

497
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,790
unapproachable,controlled, perfect.

498
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,190
She is not unapproachable.She is poised.

499
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,490
She's regal.

500
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,390
Look, I knowshe's your daughter,
and I don't want to make problems...

501
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,490
But your girlis rigid like a twig.

502
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,690
You know,she's afraid to let you in,

503
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,390
so your works of art
and she fail to achieve--

504
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,990
what's the word?

505
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,290
Symbiosis.

506
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,490
What can be doneat this stage?

507
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,590
Your daughter is beautiful,
yes,but this girl--

508
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,890
this girl has it.

509
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,590
She is warm like sunshine.She has fun.

510
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,190
She will make the clients
thinkif they buy these clothes,

511
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,490
then they will have fun, too.

512
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,390
But this is your line,eleanor.

513
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,890
It's completely your choice.

514
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,390
The rules for a model the
day of a photo shoot are

515
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,690
similar to those of
a patient presurgery--

516
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,390
***rior, wear comfortable clothing

517
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,790
and make sure your affairs are in order.

518
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,590
You never know what
could go wrong in a flash.

519
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,190
hey, B.You must either be
sleeping or already on your way.

520
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,690
But I can't wait to
see you at the shoot.

521
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,490
We're gonna have so much fun!

522
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,090
Oh, thank godyou're awake.

523
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,490
Am I late?

524
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,390
Oh, my god.Oh, my god.Did I oversleep?

525
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,590
Darling,I have some bad news.

526
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,390
Terry, that foolof a photographer, thinks
we need to go in a different direction.

527
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,290
With the theme?

528
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,790
With the model.

529
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,690
Darling, I hired these
peoplefor their expertise,

530
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,090
and ultimately,they feel that...

531
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,890
we would be doing the branda disservice.

532
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,490
I-I cannot apologize enough.

533
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,490
I know that you were
reallylooking forward to this.

534
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,590
No, I wasn'T.

535
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,390
I'm--I'm gladI
don't have to go.

536
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,390
I hate shoots.

537
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,790
They're so boring.

538
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,390
You should havealessandra
ambrosio, not an amateur.

539
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,590
We'll have dinner after,yes?

540
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,490
Steak frites and crepesat caf?des
artistes, just like old times.

541
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,690
I will see you later.

542
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,790
hey, S.

543
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,590
, All right,I hope
you're not already there,

544
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,790
because as it turns out,

545
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,290
my modeling career's over faster
thanjessica simpson's acting one.

546
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,190
Now that I think about it,

547
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,790
maybe we should crashthe shoot anyway
and see whothey replace me with,

548
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,190
make fun of the skinny bitch?

549
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,690
how could you?

550
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,090
Actually, I like this here.

551
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,190
This is no joke,humphrey.

552
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,490
What are you doingwith that?

553
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,090
The question is, what are
youdoing selling it to me?

554
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,990
You...

555
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,490
you're bex's client.

556
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,490
Oh, and you didn't know.

557
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,390
I'm just surprisedyou
hired someone with taste.

558
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,990
Oh, well,I am equally as shocked,

559
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,390
because when she said she
foundsomething amazing in brooklyn,

560
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,190
your gallery never entered my mind.

561
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,490
You'o have tactually recognizeart
to remember the place.

562
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,390
What I recognize is the fact that your
wife would not wantthis hanging in my house.

563
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,690
Alison'sa professional artist.

564
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,690
She doesn't do background checkson
prospective buyers, and neither do I.

565
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,990
Besides,it's been almost 20 years.

566
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,090
And you still don't know women.

567
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,190
And you still know it all.

568
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,690
Your wife despises me.

569
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,490
I wouldn't say that.

570
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,290
Well, she did.

571
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,090
I mean, she may have
beenwearing a slip dress

572
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,690
and doc martens at the time,but
she definitely meant it.

573
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,090
She's not like you.

574
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,390
She doesn'thold on to that stuff.

575
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,490
Why don't you calland ask her?

576
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,790
Or are you still giving herher space?

577
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,290
Because trust me,putting
this up in my house,

578
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,990
even having this conversationwith
you, will only drive herfurther away.

579
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,390
Well, what do youwant me to do then?

580
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,390
Take it back.

581
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,290
You can call bexand set up a refund.

582
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,590
So what'd you think of it?

583
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,990
I thought...

584
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,790
it was extraordinary.

585
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,090
we got*** talk.where r u

586
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,290
***call you later

587
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,490
hey, no phones.

588
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,390
Oh, right.Sorry, man.

589
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,790
How much you up?

590
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,690
That's insane, amigo.

591
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,590
I should probably
quitwhile I'm ahead, huh?

592
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,690
What?We just started.

593
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,590
Well, I've had a good run.

594
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,690
Plus, it's better to
leave while you're up.

595
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,390
I'm not--I'm not
gonnalet you do that, bro.

596
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,490
The table'sabout to get smaller.

597
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,590
People are gonna
startshowing their real stuff.

598
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,290
Up until nowit's been cards, but...

599
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,190
from now on,it's an adventure.

600
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,390
Just a couple more hands.

601
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,490
All right, gents, ante up.

602
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,490
Okay.

603
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,790
Let's hit it.

604
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,490
you've got to be kidding me.

605
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,390
Fantastic.One, two,
three, come on--oh!

606
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,590
There she is.Blair!Come on, quick.

607
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,590
What took you so long?

608
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,090
Hey.

609
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,190
Blair.

610
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,690
blairBlair, wait,where are you going?

611
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,490
Blair, wait.Why are you so mad?

612
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,690
Why am I mad?

613
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,390
You meanwhy aren't i furious?

614
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,990
I can't believefor one second I thought
that it'd be different this time!

615
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,990
You thoughtwhat would be different?

616
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,490
You couldn't deal withthe spotlight
shining on me for once, could you?

617
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,790
What are you talking about?

618
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,690
I was told we weredoing this together.

619
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,090
What, did you not get my message?

620
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,590
What about this morning then?

621
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,890
When you glanced at the call
sheet,did you see my name on it?

622
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,290
When I wasn'tin hair and
makeup, didn't that seem strange?

623
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,090
When the dressing roomonly
had your name on the door,

624
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,490
what, did you think they just forgot?

625
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,890
I was toldyou were running late, and
they asked meto do some test shots first.

626
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,390
Blair, they told me you wanted me here.

627
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,890
And you believed them?

628
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,090
Look, blair,I encouraged you to do this.

629
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,090
Why would I try to stealsomething
from you that I pushed you to do?

630
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,790
Because you take everythingfrom me!

631
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,190
- Nate, my mom!
- Blair!

632
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,390
You can't even help it.

633
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,990
It's who you are.

634
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,690
I just thought maybe this
timeit would be different.

635
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,590
I should have knownI'd be wrong.

636
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,990
Great.

637
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,090
Spotted-- lonely
boy's rude awakening.

638
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,890
Upper east side queens
aren't born at the top.

639
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,790
They climb their way up in heels, no
matter who they have to tread on to do it.

640
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,290
terry, I think it's very good.

641
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,790
I like the bridgein the
background, but we need her back.

642
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,890
I know.What--
here you are

643
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,990
terry wanted me to tell you
how perfect you looked...

644
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,490
- eleanor, I quit.
- With these now.

645
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,390
Wait a minute.Why?

646
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,590
I think you know why.

647
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,090
Because of blair?

648
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,090
I know that she will
support my decision...

649
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,490
Once I explain it to her.

650
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,590
You know you love the
spotlight.You always have.

651
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,590
It's part of your charm.

652
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,590
There is nothing
wrong with that--

653
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,890
who are you?

654
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,590
What are you doing here?

655
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,090
I have no idea, actually.I...

656
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,090
hey, I k--I kinda overheard
youguys in the stairwell there.

657
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,490
Dan, look, I really can'tgonow.

658
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,290
O-okay, well, forgetI
said anything then.

659
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,990
In fact, you know what?I'm mute.I'll
just stand hereand blink real quiet.

660
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,790
- Unless you want me
to-- - hand me my jeans?

661
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,090
Yes, please.

662
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,090
It's just, uh, I thought you
wantedto be on the sidelines here.

663
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,190
I thought you wanted to be
herefor your friend blair.

664
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:28,690
You know, we weregonna get craft service,
and I'd haveyour "full attention"?

665
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,090
Say it.

666
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,090
I-I don't think I have to.

667
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,490
So my best frienddoesn't believe me,

668
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,590
and neither doesthe guy I like.

669
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,590
Look, dan, blair's mom
basicallytricked me into coming here

670
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,490
because she didn't want blair.

671
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,990
How do you tell your best
friendsomething like that?

672
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,390
I-I didn't--I
guess I didn't--

673
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,090
look, you know what, dan?

674
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,490
Just go, okay?

675
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,690
I-I need to clean up, and
ijust need to get out of here.

676
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,990
Serena send you hereto talk to me?

677
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,490
No, believe it or not,I
actually came here myself.

678
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,190
normally, wouldn'tbe this close
to you without a tetanus shot.

679
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,290
my, uh, my mom kinda left
usa couple months ago...

680
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,690
only my...

681
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,890
my dad and my sister
don't really see that...

682
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,390
'cause she told us she hadto
go away for the summer to,

683
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,490
um, to follow her
dreamof being an artist.

684
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,190
But it's--it's
not summer anymore,

685
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,790
and she's still up there,

686
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,790
and that's all she seemsto
care about right now.

687
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,290
Every time I go to see her,
I tell myself, this time,

688
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,790
I'm gonna tell her what I think.

689
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,790
This time, I'm gonnalook
her in the eye and say,

690
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,990
"either come homeor leave for good.

691
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,190
" And so there I was,just the other day.

692
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,490
I was sittingacross the table from her,

693
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,590
looking herstraight in the
eye, and I didn't say anything.

694
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,690
Why not?

695
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,790
I don't know, but I wish I had,

696
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,690
'cause evenif it didn't change
anything, she'd know how I felt.

697
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,190
bullet, gentlemen.

698
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,890
First bet.

699
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,690
5 to call.

700
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,990
Hey, I don't have the
money.Call his bet.

701
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,090
It's all luck.

702
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,290
Hey, you guysokay with a marker?

703
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,890
I don't thinkthat's such a good idea.

704
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,590
If you're ever gonnatake
a risk, start now.

705
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,490
What's the pointof anything less?

706
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,490
it's fine.

707
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,990
You sure he's goodfor it?

708
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,090
Of course he is.

709
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,690
He's an archibald.

710
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,390
make it $10,000.

711
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,590
five to call.

712
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,190
call.

713
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,990
Show your cards.

714
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,490
Trip bullets.The trip aces take it.

715
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,490
- That's rough.
- You told me to.

716
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,990
It's the luck of the draw,my friend.

717
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,690
He--he had
three aces.

718
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,790
Look, I don't, um, it might take
me a little while to get the money.

719
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,790
Wait, wait, wait.Wait.

720
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,090
A little while?

721
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,490
come on, man.

722
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,390
Snap your fingers.

723
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,790
Wait a minute.

724
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,590
Are you in with these guys?

725
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,890
Did you play me, man?Are
you playing me, huh?

726
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,490
hey, hey, hold on.

727
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,490
I guess that's a yes.

728
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,390
Just give him the money,
man.Money means nothing to you.

729
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,190
This guys aren't playing,but
no one has to get hurt.

730
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,190
I'm trying to help you out.

731
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,790
yeah,you're a real friend.

732
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,090
Who let you in here, bass?

733
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,090
He set me up.

734
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,990
No one forced his hand.

735
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,690
- Your boy lost fair and square.
- Did you?

736
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,390
Look, man, if you don't
get 'emthe money right away,

737
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,690
I'm gonna tell everyonewhere you live,

738
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,790
and they can come get itfrom your d...

739
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,690
What do you think about that?

740
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,590
Look.

741
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,490
Look, you got my watchand my ball.

742
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,590
You keep them.

743
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,890
Take care of these guys.

744
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,890
I don't call the cops,
and we walk out of here.

745
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,290
it's cool.I-I-I
got it.I got it.

746
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,190
I'm gonna haveto transfer some money
and pray the captaindoesn't notice

747
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,390
before I find a way to put it back.

748
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,890
You don't haveto pay me back, you know.

749
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,290
I mean, it was worth every
centto see the last of that guy.

750
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,890
No, I want to.

751
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,190
I mean it.

752
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,390
Thanks.

753
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,490
- that can't be right.
- What's up?

754
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,590
It says I'm zeroed out.

755
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,890
Maybe you have the wrong account.

756
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,690
No, no, no, no.There
must be something wrong.

757
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,490
I accessed this accountlast month,
and it said there wasalmost $200,000.

758
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,390
hey, tom, thanks for
gettingback to me so quickly.

759
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,590
Your message said it was important.

760
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,690
Um, yeah, I was--I was
checking my accounts,

761
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,590
and I came acrosswhat
I assume to be an error,

762
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,190
in that my trust seemsto
have a zero balance.

763
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,090
Oh, uh, I thought you knew.

764
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,590
That account was drainedweeks ago.

765
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,990
Drained?

766
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,690
But by who?

767
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,090
Your father.

768
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,090
He said he discussed itwith you.

769
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,590
We--we have to solve this.I
mean, what are we gonna do?

770
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,490
I'm not into gettinga lingerie model.

771
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,290
Uh, blair, honey, there's
beena terrible mistake.

772
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,390
How would you likeyour job back?

773
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,990
Did you choose serenaover me?

774
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,490
You could've pickeda stranger.

775
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,490
You didn't have to choosemy best friend.

776
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,290
What, did you thinkthat
I wouldn't find out?

777
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,890
I was going to tell youtonight...

778
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,190
at dinner.

779
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,490
It--there wasno right
decision.There...

780
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,690
there--there
wasn't any time.

781
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,790
I know you can understandall this.

782
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,790
It was mishandled-- the whole
thing--from top to bottom.

783
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,790
You actually want meto agree with you.

784
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,590
Bendel's will legitimizethis company.

785
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,390
It will take everythingto
the next level.

786
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,590
You know how hardI have worked for that.

787
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,990
You've always been my
biggestsupporter, my biggest fan.

788
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,690
I'm your daughter.

789
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,390
And as my daughter, I knew
that you wouldforgive me,

790
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,890
in time, but if my company had
lostthis deal because of you?

791
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,790
I'd never forgive myself.

792
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,290
I hope you never do.

793
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,890
You didn't hear it from us,
but in every girl's life,

794
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,690
there comes a moment when she realizes

795
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,590
that her mother just might
be more messed up than she is.

796
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,790
you're still here?

797
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,190
Yeah, well,I thought I couldn't leave

798
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,190
without bringing yousomething
from craft service.

799
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,490
Um, and, uh, and telling
youthat I'm sorry I judged you.

800
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,390
Well, I'm sorryI gave you reason to.

801
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,490
Hey, how aboutyou ask me out again?

802
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,390
How aboutyou actually show up?

803
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,290
Okay.

804
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,690
No drama,no disruptions.I promise.

805
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,490
You promise?Oh, no!That
meansit's never gonna happen now.

806
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,590
Okay, quick.I take it back.I unpromise.

807
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,090
Friday.8:00.

808
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,190
I think we can agreeto those terms,

809
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,790
but you can't wearthose shoes.

810
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,190
Or that hair.

811
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,590
Blair.

812
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,090
Okay, see you then.

813
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,490
All right.

814
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,190
- so you were right.
- I know.

815
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,090
When I got that call,I should've
known you had nothing to dowith it.

816
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,690
And I should never have pushedyou to
do this whole thing in the first place.

817
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:53,290
Actually,I'm glad you pushed me it ended
up beinga very important day for me.

818
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,590
I just thoughtit was gonna be more fun.

819
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,790
I know.Me, too.

820
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,190
hey, you know what?

821
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,390
Who says it still can't be?

822
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,190
come on.Come on.

823
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,890
this just in-- S.And
B.Committing a crime of fashion.

824
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,590
Who doesn't love a 5-finger discount?

825
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,490
Especially if one of those
fingers is the middle one.

826
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,990
Where are my clothes?

827
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,790
Everyone knows you
can't choose your family,

828
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,790
but you can choose your friends,

829
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,990
and in a world ruled by bloodlines and
bank accounts, it pays to have a pal.

830
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,390
Do it again.One,
two--one, two, three.

831
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,290
as a B.F.F can make you go W.T.F,

832
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,690
there's no denying we'd all be
a little less rich without them.

833
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,490
And serena and blair--they
do besties better than anyone.

834
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,290
no, that's not a tear in my eye.

835
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,990
It's just allergies.

836
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,390
Without you, I'm nothing.

837
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,190
