1
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:05,727
Hey, Cory. Brought you
a great article on Barry Bonds.

2
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:08,036
Ah, the $43-million man.

3
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,303
Why do they call him that?

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,503
Because that's what
he's getting paid...

5
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,205
to play baseball for six years.

6
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:15,613
7.16 million a year?

7
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:18,618
If that's what
it comes out to, yeah.

8
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:21,485
He happens to be one of
the top guys in baseball.

9
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,387
Well, I happen to think
Mr. Feeny is...

10
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,981
one of the top guys
in teaching...

11
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,721
and he makes
about 40,000 a year.

12
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,422
That stinks.

13
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,522
Finally.
Something we agree on.

14
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:32,725
Yeah.

15
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,927
Feeny ain't worth
that kind of money.

16
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,436
You thought
I meant he was overpaid?

17
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,439
I meant that Mr. Feeny...

18
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,998
is grossly and tragically
underpaid.

19
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,010
Minkus--
May I call you Minkus?

20
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,012
Does spelling ever change?
No.

21
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,514
Does history ever change?
Uh-uh.

22
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,517
Does Feeny ever change?
Never.

23
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,519
Know why?
He doesn't have to.

24
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,521
Know why?
'Cause nothing about...

25
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,523
teaching sixth grade
ever changes.

26
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,854
Well, I think you're wrong.

27
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,358
Well, IthinkI'm right.

28
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,793
I think in about five seconds,

Feeny walks in here...

29
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,796
takes a sip from
the drinking fountain...

30
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,424
flicks his mustache,

goes to the coffee machine...

31
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,900
sees me, and says,
"Good morning, Mr. Matthews.

32
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,369
"l trust
you've done the homework."

33
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,201
Every day the same thing.

34
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,833
He's so predictable.

35
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,437
Good morning, Mr. Matthews.

36
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,845
I trust you've done
the homework.

37
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,349
Yes, I did, sir.

38
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:27,217
BoTH:
But my little sister ate it.

39
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,620
You are so predictable.

40
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,016
This Week in Social Studies...

41
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:36,716
we'll be talking about
prejudice.

42
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,225
Good, 'cause I'm prejudiced
against the scungy food...

43
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,817
in the cafeteria.

44
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,158
[Class laughs]

45
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,863
We will be discussing
black slavery...

46
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,628
in the American South...

47
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,966
the Jews in Nazi Germany...

48
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,097
and several examples of
prejudice throughout history.

49
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,607
Tonight your assignment...

50
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,838
is to read the first 30 pages
of that book.

51
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:00,346
Aw, man,

it's a book about some girl.

52
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,905
[Bell rings]

53
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,712
Mr. Matthews.

54
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,218
I'll read it anyway.

55
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:09,051
I'll do my homework, really.

56
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:11,057
I note
an escalating tendency...

57
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,059
for you to make
humorous comments...

58
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:15,561
about the things I'm teaching,
Mr. Matthews.

59
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,063
You are making my job
very difficult.

60
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:20,828
We both know it's not very hard
to teach sixth grade...

61
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,562
so I always thought
you secretly liked...

62
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,627
that I make it
a little more challenging.

63
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:28,198
oh, so that's it.

My job is easy.

64
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,175
Well, you know,
same stuff every year.

65
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,178
The only thing that changes
is the students.

66
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,375
You know, I always thought
you had the easy job...

67
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,111
just sitting in class,
listening.

68
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,618
Are you kidding?

69
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,621
Thirty-five hours a week
in here with you?

70
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,122
Major homework every night?

71
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,623
It never stops, Mr. Feeny.

72
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:47,126
And want to know
what I get for all that?

73
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,060
Five measly bucks a week.

74
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,428
You probably
make that in an hour.

75
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:52,659
Yes, I do.

76
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:56,032
That's why I can afford
that Ferrari in my driveway.

77
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,037
You don't drive a Ferrari.

78
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,130
oh, right. It's a Gremlin.

79
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,838
In any event, perhaps
I have been underestimating...

80
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,540
the difficulty of
your job as a sixth-grader.

81
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,776
Well, perhaps you have,
Mr. Feeny.

82
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,613
-Mmm.
-What?

83
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:15,280
I could give you a chance
to prove your theory.

84
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,222
What do you mean?

85
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,717
Why don't we trade jobs
for the rest of the week?

86
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,821
Because you wouldn't do that.

87
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,331
oh, yes, I would.

88
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:28,334
You may teach one of my classes
until Friday...

89
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,836
at which point,
you will administer a test...

90
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,031
that I have prepared.

91
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,097
Will I have to take it?

92
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,939
You'll be the teacher,

Mr. Matthews.

93
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:41,141
You'll be having the easy job--
giving the test.

94
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:45,379
And if more students
than normal pass, you win.

95
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,751
And if more students fail,

I win.

96
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,816
So while I'm doing your job,
what are you going to do?

97
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,327
Well, since you'll be sitting
in my seat...

98
00:04:55,362 --> 00:05:00,061
I think it's only fair that
I should be sitting in yours.

99
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,331
You mean, you'd be, like,
my student?

100
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,895
Like...yeah.

101
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,066
Yes!

102
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,268
Would you enjoy that?

103
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,776
Yeah, that'd be oK.

104
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,972
And you'd be
taking the test, right?

105
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,241
Right.

106
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:17,580
oK. Deal.
Just how you said.

107
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,948
No take-backs.

108
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,452
No take-backs.

109
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:24,218
But why don't we make
this experiment...

110
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,088
a little more interesting?

111
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,632
Hi, Mom. Hey, Weez.

112
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,435
-Hey, Eric.
-Hi, new girlfriend.

113
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,441
oh, ignore her.
When she was born...

114
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,443
the doctor had to pry
her little foot...

115
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,775
out of her big mouth.

116
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,247
Hi, I'm the mom.

It's nice to meet you.

117
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,442
Hi.

118
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,577
My name's Morgan,
and I'm 5 1/2.

119
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,317
Well, my name is Linda,
and I'm 1 5 3/4.

120
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,190
I like her!

121
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:01,694
You guys want something to eat?

122
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,195
Sure. Could you...

123
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,424
Morgan, honey...

124
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,193
I could really, really use
your help in the kitchen.

125
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:09,794
You're just going to have
to be more independent...

126
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,828
'cause I want to stay
and talk to Linda.

127
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,001
I tried.

128
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,772
So...you think
I'm a new girlfriend, do you?

129
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,006
Uh-huh.

130
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,514
Guys, could we talk about,
like, anything else?

131
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,676
Are there a lot of
old girlfriends?

132
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,151
Billions.

133
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,552
Does anyone else have
that real sharp pain...

134
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,647
behind their eyes?
I know I do.

135
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,157
Well, I don't think

I'm a new girlfriend.

136
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:35,286
Your brother told me that
he just wanted to study with me.

137
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:39,389
oh, please. You're going
to fall for that one?

138
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,902
Major snackage
is now being served...

139
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,961
in the main dining room.

140
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,905
Come on, it's getting cold.

141
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,909
-It's ice cream.
-Come on, it's getting warm.

142
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,935
So, isn't it about time

Morgan got her own apartment?

143
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,952
Whoa! That bike is fast.

144
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:03,217
I heard your engine groaning
on that last hill, Dad.

145
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,689
Were you two racing?

146
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,783
No, no.

I was just rushing home...

147
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,021
and Dad happened to see me
and tried to catch up.

148
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:12,156
-Racing.
-Hurrying in a manly fashion.

149
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,689
Now, why were you
rushing to get home?

150
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,031
I think you'd hang around
school a while...

151
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,297
and show off your new bike.

152
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,305
I couldn't wait to tell you.

153
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,966
Mr. Feeny and I made a bet...

154
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,475
that I could teach Social
Studies better than he can.

155
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,035
I'm gonna be the teacher
for the rest of the week.

156
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,444
Isn't that great?

157
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,142
Cory, you barely manage
a C-plus in Social Studies.

158
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,343
How you gonna teach it?

159
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,353
Hey, Mom.
The book does all the teaching.

160
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,413
Feeny's just Vanna White
pointing to the letters.

161
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,927
What exactly did
you two high rollers bet?

162
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,793
Well, I put up my bike.

163
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,424
What?
I just bought you that bike!

164
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,867
Relax, Dad. Feeny's the one
who's going to lose big.

165
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,235
What did Mr. Feeny put up
against your bike...

166
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,432
his Garden Weasel?

167
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,239
one-fifth of
his weekly paycheck...

168
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,802
'cause I'm teaching
one of his five classes.

169
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,837
And come Friday, I'm rich!

170
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,151
Why does Feeny want that bike?

171
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,653
oh, Alan, obviously...

172
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,656
this is one of
those Mr. Feeny lesson things.

173
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,749
Well, what if the lesson is...

174
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,692
"l want that bike"?

175
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,465
Now, I'm really in charge.

176
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,232
You're not going
to call the bet off...

177
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,136
if I do things
a teensy bit different...

178
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,640
from the way you would?

179
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,643
We made a bet, Mr. Matthews.

180
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,840
It's your class.
They are your minds to mold.

181
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,714
Cool!

182
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,946
Good morning, class.

183
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,886
For the rest of the Week...

184
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,549
I'm going to be
your Social Studies teacher.

185
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:47,617
Mr. Feeny? What's going on?

186
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,922
Don't ask me.
He's the man in charge.

187
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,730
That's right,
Minkus, my boy. Me.

188
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,569
I'm your new teacher,
and my name is...

189
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,071
Hey...

190
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,814
Dude.

191
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:15,547
That all right
with you...George?

192
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:19,319
Mi cLase es su cLase.

193
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:24,422
And you guys know that rule
about no baseball caps in class?

194
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,022
History!

195
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,363
BOYS: Yeah!

196
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,327
Yeah, Topanga.

197
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,339
If we're going to eliminate
the cap rule...

198
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,570
can we also discard
the dress code in its entirety?

199
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,578
Why? You're not thinking about
showing up...

200
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,944
Iike, naked tomorrow, are you?

201
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,141
CLASS: ooh!

202
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:46,641
No. Although I find
nothing shameful about nudity.

203
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,654
I was thinking about
wearing garments...

204
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,156
from cultures more in tune
with the goddess.

205
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,591
A sari, perhaps, or a pareo.

206
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,220
Yeah, fine.

As long as you're covered up.

207
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,494
People, people, people.

208
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,727
Are we going to do
our Social Studies work today?

209
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,259
Minkus, Minkus, Minkus.

210
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,498
Shut up.

211
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,874
oK, guys,
for homework tonight...

212
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,901
read the first 30 pages
in Whatever that book Was...

213
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,005
that George assigned us
yesterday.

214
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,016
But that was
the assignment last night.

215
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,851
Minkus! Not long ago,
I was a student myself...

216
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:24,356
and I remember
that sixth-graders...

217
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,358
don't always
do their homework...

218
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,122
so this way,
everyone gets a second chance.

219
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:34,464
Excuse me, Mr. Hey Dude,
but I did my homework.

220
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,128
Minkus, get a life.

221
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:39,138
That's your homework assignment.
Get a life.

222
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,844
Hey, Dad. Hey, Weez.

223
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:48,041
Hey, Weasel, check it out.
Look what Linda sent for you.

224
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,606
It's beautiful. What is it?

225
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,483
This is a genuine
Japanese lantern.

226
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,817
That was very nice of Linda.

227
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,321
Yeah. She brought it
all the way back from Tokyo...

228
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:57,721
and she wants you to have it.

229
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,918
Look, you put it over the lamp
you have in your room...

230
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,756
all the pretty colors
will shine through.

231
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,261
I'm gonna try it right now.

232
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,264
-All right.
-How was your day?

233
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,357
I can't talk, Dad.

I got to go call Linda.

234
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,265
Didn't you
just leave her house?

235
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,792
That was 10 minutes ago.

236
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:17,431
I'm the greatest teacher
in the history of the universe.

237
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,035
It went that well, huh?

238
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,275
By the end of the day,
it was one big class party.

239
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,545
Well, what was Mr. Feeny doing
during this party?

240
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:27,917
Shawn was teaching him
how to play poker for gum.

241
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,548
Well, when did you actually
teach the lesson?

242
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,423
I told you, Dad. The teacher
doesn't really do anything.

243
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,427
You read the book,

you pass the test.

244
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,894
Did you read the book?

245
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,363
I skimmed it.

246
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,525
Well, what was it about?

247
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:43,035
It was about
the Nazis and the Jews...

248
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,536
a long time ago.

249
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,038
When there was prejudice
and stuff.

250
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,733
A long time ago.

251
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,368
Yeah.
The stuff is history, Dad.

252
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,073
Cory, not that I suddenly think
your bike is in, like...

253
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,911
real significant danger
here, but...

254
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,919
could you give me
the details of this bet again?

255
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,683
oK. Based on the way
he grades...

256
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,417
if more students
than usual pass the test...

257
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,617
then I win.

258
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,592
-Based on the way he grades.
-Right.

259
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,094
-How does he grade?
-Huh?

260
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,595
-Does he on a curve?
-Huh?

261
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,393
Feeny's gonna score
pretty high, right?

262
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:13,626
He Wrote the test.

263
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,134
Cory, figure it out.
He grades on the curve.

264
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,729
The higher he scores,
the more kids will fail.

265
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,363
What does that mean?

266
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,102
That means your bike is gone.

267
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:33,174
Look, you have to help me get
the class back under control.

268
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,982
Hey, you're the one
who let it get out of control.

269
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,683
Well, you're the one
playing poker with Feeny.

270
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,191
Lighten up, man.

271
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,092
You're starting to sound
like a teacher.

272
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,993
[Bell rings]

273
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,124
Topanga, What are you doing?

274
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,997
Moving my desk out of the way.

275
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:52,527
I've decided I'd rather sit on
a traditional yoga cushion.

276
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,276
oh, come on, Minkus,

don't tell me...

277
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:03,339
you want to sit on
a yogurt cushion!

278
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,851
No. You told me to get a life.

279
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,877
Now I'm going to be as fun
as the next guy.

280
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:14,853
oK. I know things got
a little loose here yesterday...

281
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,419
but we've got a test
day after tomorrow...

282
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,556
and it's time to get down
to business.

283
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,899
Let's start With the roll call.

284
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,433
Lawrence, Topanga.

285
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,032
I'm channeling.

286
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,772
I will only answer
to the name...

287
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,009
[Growls]

288
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:48,725
oK. Present, but not all here.

289
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,855
Hunter, Shawn.

290
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,400
Hunter, Shawn.

291
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,268
out of my face.
I'm stacking the deck.

292
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,831
Hey. Where's Mr. Feeny?
I mean, George.

293
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:05,435
Hey, dude. Sorry I'm late.

294
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:08,447
I was chillin' with my homies.

295
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,211
I'm in.

296
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:17,379
Minkus, this is Social Studies.

297
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,550
Stop making those paper turkeys.

298
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,925
They're flamingoes,
and quit calling me Minkus.

299
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,430
You call everyone else
by their first name...

300
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:29,128
so start calling me Stuart.

301
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,035
I see your Juicy Fruit...

302
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,869
and I raise you a Chiclet.

303
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,311
Still reading that book,
huh, Cor?

304
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,823
Just trying
to prepare for class.

305
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,986
You know, this teaching stuff
isn't as easy as it looks.

306
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,494
It's not, huh?

307
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,498
Nope. Nobody in class will pay
any attention to me.

308
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,000
Well, maybe that's because
you tried to be their pal...

309
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,002
instead of their teacher.

310
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,005
Maybe you need to set yourself
apart from the class...

311
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,529
be more authoritative.

312
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,872
-How do I do that?
-How does Feeny do it?

313
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,969
I don't know.
I never paid attention.

314
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,144
Come on, let's go sit
on the couch, all right?

315
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,154
Eric?

316
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,348
I got it, Cor.

317
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,879
[Crying]

318
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,916
Everything is
going to be oK, all right?

319
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,894
Eric?

320
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,295
I'll talk to you later, Cor.

321
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,460
It's getting chilly out there.

322
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,695
Linda! Linda!

323
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,167
What's wrong with Linda?

324
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:44,108
Some jerk at the mall
called her a bad name.

325
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,304
Where? our mall?

326
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,540
What did he call you?

327
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,947
It's not important, Morgan.

328
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,644
In our mall right here?

329
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,016
Thank you.

330
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:58,888
A boy at daycare
once called me poo-poo head.

331
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,722
Thanks, Morgan.

332
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,920
Mom.

333
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,394
Come on, Morgan.

334
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,863
Let's make some hot cocoa
for everybody.

335
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:12,304
Man, sometimes

people can be total idiots.

336
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,329
This happened today?

337
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:26,649
SHAWN: Hey, Mr. GQ.
Nice neckwear.

338
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:29,655
Excellent Windsor knot.
Did your mom tie it?

339
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:33,557
Minkus--
Stuart, I need your help.

340
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,424
You're the smartest kid
in class...

341
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:36,951
and maybe if
you pay attention to me...

342
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,486
some of the other kids will.

343
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,123
Why should I help you?

344
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:44,000
You made fun of Mr. Feeny
and said he gets paid too much.

345
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,298
[Bell rings]

346
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,498
Hey, dude.

347
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,167
ooh, that suit.

348
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,005
It's not cool.

349
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,479
Class, I'd like to talk to you
today about prejudice...

350
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:01,476
and how it still exists
in today's world.

351
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,490
I didn't even know that
till last night...

352
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:08,483
when I saw a real smart,

totally cool Asian girl...

353
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,487
crying her eyes out because
some idiot at the mall...

354
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,432
called her a bad name.

355
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,869
My lesson for today...

356
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:21,533
is that when people treat
other people badly...

357
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:25,943
because of their skin color
or their religion...

358
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,946
or where they come from...

359
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,448
then real smart,

totally cool people...

360
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,713
can really suffer.

361
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,720
SHAWN:
Hey, George, this isn't gum.

362
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,847
These are Rolaids.

363
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,120
Deal me out of this one,

Mr. Hunter.

364
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,024
What? Why?

365
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,221
oK. You win.

366
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,786
I'm a crummy teacher,
and I resign.

367
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,969
Hey, Shawn, before your mother
got married...

368
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,444
what was her name again?

369
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,639
Cordini.

370
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,148
Cordini.

371
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:07,482
So, that would make you
a wop, right?

372
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,454
What did you call me?

373
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,956
You heard what I called you.

374
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,458
Did you hear what he called me?

375
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,925
I heard what he called you.

376
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,929
What are you
going to do about it?

377
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,123
He's the teacher.

378
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:19,995
What are you
going to do about it?

379
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,499
I'm gonna knock his head off!

380
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:22,899
What if you couldn't?

381
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,802
What if you couldn't
do anything about it?

382
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,066
What?

383
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,506
What if you lived in a country
where I could kill you...

384
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,703
just because of
your mom's last name?

385
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,837
Cory, what are you
talking about?

386
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:37,872
A 1 5-year-old girl is dead!

387
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,683
Doesn't anybody care?

388
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,153
Cory...

389
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:50,026
She was real smart
and totally cool.

390
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,792
She wrote this book.

391
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:55,892
Her name Was Anne Frank.

392
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:59,063
They say she died of typhus...

393
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,471
but they killed her...

394
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,941
because her name Was Anne Frank.

395
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:09,645
Anne Frank was
a victim of antisemitism.

396
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:12,082
Anti-Semitism.

397
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,013
Thank you, Mr. Feeny.

398
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:19,157
You have to read this book...

399
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:22,718
and you have to pass
this test...

400
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,423
not because of me...

401
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:28,490
but because when someone
calls someone else a bad name...

402
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:32,994
it's not good that
just that one person jumps up.

403
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,030
We all have to jump up.

404
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,683
"ln spite of everything...

405
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:48,278
"l still believe that people
are really good at heart."

406
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,725
So, what's the verdict?

407
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,559
Am I riding the bus to school
from now on?

408
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,862
No. The same number of students
passed the test as usual.

409
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,835
It's a draw.
You get to keep your bike.

410
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,530
Good.

411
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:09,007
You mean
some people still failed?

412
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,805
It happens no matter how good
a teacher you are.

413
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,471
Sorry to hear that.

414
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,072
I guess I didn't do
such a good job.

415
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:20,051
on the contrary, Mr. Matthews,
you did an excellent job.

416
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,553
Mr. Hunter, for instance...

417
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,317
got a full grade higher
than he usually does.

418
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,654
Somehow you must have
gotten his attention.

419
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,159
Shawn got a "B"?

420
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:29,422
Mm-hmm.

421
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:32,158
At least one guy learned
something from me this week.

422
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,894
-TWo.
-TWo? Who else?

423
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,834
You, Mr. Matthews.

424
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,337
But how do you know?
I didn't even take the test.

425
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:40,838
You didn't have to.

426
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,841
Do you really think
that I could have gotten you...

427
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,275
to read
"The Diary of Anne Frank"?

428
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,938
Even if you did, Mr. Feeny...

429
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,812
I still wouldn't have
understood it without you.

430
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:55,344
People just don't understand
that about us teachers.

431
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,355
That's all right, Mr. Matthews.

432
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:02,520
In time, one learns to live

with the lack of respect...

433
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:06,554
unruly students,
and minuscule pay.

434
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,558
Rolaid?

435
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,578
Hey, Mom, guess what?

436
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,810
This Saturday night
I got a date with a cheerleader.

437
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,077
What happened to Linda?

438
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,244
She was so sweet,

and I was really liking her.

439
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,379
Ma, Linda is the cheerleader.

She made the team.

440
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,888
oh, that's great.

441
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:32,914
I'm dating a popular girl
all because...

442
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,052
I was smart enough to get in
on the ground floor.

443
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:39,121
Cheerleading is such
a great experience for a girl.

444
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:40,462
You know, I was a cheerleader.

445
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:41,966
They had them back then?

446
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,595
Yes, back then...

447
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,105
when the football
was made out of a rock.

448
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,040
Let's see, my big cheer was...

Thank you.

458
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:15,328
Dated, unbelievably uncool,
but cute.

[Doorbell chimes]

460
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:19,404
Mom, cheerleading isn't
that rah-rah stuff anymore.

461
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,133
It's cool, you know.

462
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,573
It's--it's cutting-edge.

463
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:24,803
-Hi.
-Hi.

464
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,472
Hey, congratulations.
You made the squad.

465
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,913
Thanks. I just had
my first practice today.

466
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,940
Why don't you show my mom
something you learned...

467
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,248
so at least she knows
what's going on nowadays?

468
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:37,119
-oK, sure.
