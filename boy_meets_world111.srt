Good morning, pumpkin.

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:06,565
I've been up since 6:00!

3
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,006
Nice mess.

4
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,339
It's my biggest.

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,972
Friday. I love Friday.

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,539
Soon I'm gonna be home
for the whole weekend.

7

Friday. I hate Friday.

for the whole weekend.

Let me give you
a weekend weather update.

12

Whether or not I have a date
with Cindy this weekend...

13
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,428
depends on how partly cool
I am in school today.

14
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,560
There is a definite Vicki front
moving in this Saturday...

15
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,365
and temperatures
are expected to rise.

16

Cooling off by 10:00,
when you're expected to be home.

oh, Mom, we both know...

18
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:42,808
how unpredictable
the weather can be.

19
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:44,310
Don't mess With Mother Nature.

20
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,834
I'll be home by 10:00.

Hey, Mom,
where's my blue sugar moons?

Where's my marshmallow

23
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,414
This cereal's bogus.

24
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,354
It's full of hamster food
and corn flake dust.

25
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,914
Where's all the good stuff?

26
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:58,982
Morgan?

27
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:01,551
She took out
all the good stuff.

Morgan, all this is
is sugar-coated...sugar.

I'm feeling very perky.

Why don't we go up
to your room, honey?

32

How come? How come? How come?
How come? How come?

right away...

you shouldn't do breakfast.

How are you feeling today,

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,267
You know, Dad,

most people put their gloves...

46

under the mattress
to break them in.

47

don't have a glove...

25 years ago, Eric.

you baste it with Glovolium...

in a slow oven...

Me? It's not about
me playing. It's us.

59
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,656

without you guys.

Yeah, that's nice.

Yeah. Why don't they
just give us the trophy?

much too zen for baseball.

I couldn't help noticing...

82
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,636
that you didn't recite
the Pledge of Allegiance...

83
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:01,641
this morning.

84
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,200
Yes, sir. I elected not to.

85
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,178
Why was that?

00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,647
I didn't feel like it.

This is gonna be cool.

00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,152
What was that,

Mr. Matthews?

89
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,781
Uh, I said, this is

gonna be cool, Mr. Feeny.

90
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:17,881

I think it's weird
to pick on me...

94
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:33,470

the pledge of allegiance.

00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,504
Well, Mr. Matthews...

96
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,376

you and Miss Lawrence...

Miss Lawrence,

defend the right to dissent.

107
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:11,635
Just because it's a tradition
doesn't mean you have to do it.

108

But it's the Pledge
of Allegiance.

109
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,411
It takes, like,

ten seconds to say.

110
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,848
Why can't you just say it
and make everyone happy?

111
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,546
Because if I'm forced
to do it just because...

112
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,555
it's some tradition
I don't understand...

113

00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:05,017
Gee, I guess
we just missed him.

177
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,383
Hey, Minkus,
isn't that Stephen Hawking?

178
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,546
Where?

179
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,722
oh, darn. I missed him, too.

180
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,057
Well, see ya.

181
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:20,689
Why do they think
he's so much smarter than us?

182
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,695
Because he is, isn't he?

183
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,621
He's out there
practicing for tomorrow.

184
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,632
-We're trapped.
-What are we gonna do?

185
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,826
There's no way out.

186
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,335
MOM: Out of what?

187
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,132
That's Mom.

188
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,661
Yes, it is.

189
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,367
We're gonna have
to tell her.

190
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,966
Yes, we are.

191
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:07,605
Mom, we don't want to play
in the father/son softball game.

192
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,172
Why is this my problem?

193
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,241
Look, I think what

my-less-than-tactful...

194
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,877
Iittle brother
is trying to say...

195
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,378
is that these father/son
softball games are...

196
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,891
Not real exciting for you.

197
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,085
-Right.
-Right.

198
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,991
So you understand
what we're saying.

199
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,893
I understand that
neither one of you...

200
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,558
is willing to give up a couple
of hours on a Saturday...

201
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,363
For something your father's
really looking forward to doing.

202
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,893
I'm really looking forward
to my date with Vicki tomorrow.

203
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,428
I mean, why should
I give that up?

204
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,304
Hey, Mom,
why don't you play?

205
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,467
Yeah.

206
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,478
Look, if this was

a husband/wife softball game...

207
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,979
believe me, I'd be there.

208
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,982
But it's not, thank God.

209
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,007
It's a father/son game.

210
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:49,249
Look, we're just asking you
to get us off the hook.

211
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,018
No. This is your hook...

212
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:55,460
and you're gonna hang on it
like the worms you are.

213
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:58,896
Mom, you're not walking out
on us for good, are you?

214
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,230
I'm going to the bank.
Your heartless father...

215
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,394
asked me to deposit
his paycheck...

216
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,030
so we could pay the bills.
oh, the nerve.

217
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,198
Where are you going?
I want to go with you.

218
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,366
Where are you going?

219
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,205
No, honey. There's
long lines at the bank...

220
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,642
and there's
no place to sit.

221
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,942
It'd be a lot easier for me
and more fun for you...

222
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,380
if you stayed here
and played with your toys.

223
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,884
I'm going to the bank
with Mommy.

224
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,652
oK, Eric. You're older.

225
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,659
I'm counting on you
to get us out of this.

226
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,285
-I can do it.
-I know you can.

227
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,296
-I've got it.
-I knew you could!

228
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,298
Look, it's

the father/son game, right?

229
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,562
Not the father/sons game.

230
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:35,568
A loophole.

231
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,263
only one of us has to go.

232
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,498
Ring, ring.

233
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:40,597
Hello?

234
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,108
It's the governor.
We're saved!

235
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,542
You're a genius!

236
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,067
Yes, I am. Hey,
good luck at the game.

237
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,807
Remember,

when all Dad's friends...

238
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,042
go up and tousle your hair
and call you "tiger"...

239
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,176
here's what a sincere
smile looks like.

240
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,786
Time out, tooth boy.
Why do I have to go?

241
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,292
Look, Cory, I'd go...

242
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,453
but what if Dad and I started
talking about golf...

243
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,292
talked about how someone
broke his driver...

244
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,922
in the backyard
hittin' rocks with it?

245
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,057
-You wouldn't.
-I would.

246
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,067
-You wouldn't.
-I would.

247
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,569
oK, fine. I'm gonna go.

248
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,265
But wait. What if Dad
starts joking around...

249
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,967
about how nervous he is
that you're getting...

250
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,600
your driver's license
next year?

251
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,167
I'd have to calm
him down by saying...

252
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,008
"Eric's driven your car
around the block...

253
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,707
"a thousand times,

and nothing's ever happened."

254
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:22,715
-You wouldn't.
-I would.

255
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:23,716
-You wouldn't.
-I would.

256
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,413
-You wouldn't.
-What are you, new?

257
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,545
Look, I'm not going.

258
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:29,612
Well, I'm not, either.

259
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,681
I guess the only fair way
is to let Dad decide.

260
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:32,691
-Fine.
-Fine.

261
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,556
May the best excuse win.

262
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:35,925
-Dad!
-Dad!

263
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:39,420
[Both shouting at once]

264
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,433
Hey, stop, stop, stop, stop.

265
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,300
Start all over again...
this time in English.

266
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,862
[Both talking at once]

267
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,669
Whoa, whoa. No, try again.

268
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,336
one at a time. You first.

269
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,345
Look, Dad, I can't play in
the softball game tomorrow.

270
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,540
See, Vicki and I have this

really important project...

271
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,243
due next week, and, well,

we've had...

272
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,444
this study date planned
since, like, 1942--

273
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,010
-What subject?
-Science.

274
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,317
You're not in the same class.

275
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,916
We have identical projects
due on the same day, oK?

276
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,358
oh, amazing coincidence.

277
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,917
Isn't it? Look, anyway...

278
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,862
I'm supposed to meet her
at the library tomorrow--

279
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,023
Meet her on Sunday.

280
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,430
The library's closed sunday.

281
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,161
Not anymore.
They changed the hours.

282
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,691
Guys, I got
to tell you something.

283
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,567
Dad, unbelievably,
my left leg...

284
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,197
has to be tested
for radon tomorrow.

285
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,208
I just got a phone call.

286
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,709
Yeah, it's probably nothing...

287
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,711
but I'm the last guy
to endanger my family...

288
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,076
and the testing's free.

289
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,206
The game has been canceled.

290
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,841
And I told them,

"Take the leg off...

291
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:35,377
"because, darn it, I got
a softball game with my dad!"

292
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,049
They couldn't generate
enough interest.

293
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,058
That stinks.

294
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,150
Yeah, I was psyched.

295
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,455
Ah, don't worry about it.

296
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,689
There'll be other games.

297
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,457
Hey, is the library
really open on Sunday?

298
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,762
How do I know?

299
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,359
Not bad.

300
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,038
So, how was your weekend?

301
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,171
Ah, one of

the all-time greats.

302
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,841
I slept in,
I Watched TV...

303
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,146
I relaxed,

I played video games.

304
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,652
And Sunday, I took it easy.

305
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,348
Hi, Cory.

306
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:12,552
Hey, look who just
beamed down.

307
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,150
Hi, Topanga.

308
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,024
I missed you
at the game Saturday.

309
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,029
What game?

310
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:20,032
Your father's grocery store
against my father's bookstore.

311
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:23,558
Uh, Topanga, in this dimension,
there was no game.

312
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,628
Yes, there was. I played.

313
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,232
Topanga,
that game was canceled.

314
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,401
You wish.
We were killing you...

315
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,206
until your father's
assistant manager...

316
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,213
tried to throw the ball home
from center field...

317
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,714
and sprained his elbow.

318
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,909
The ambulance had to come
and take him away.

319
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,544
There's always an ambulance.

320
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:44,044
My father told me
that game was called off.

321
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,580
Well, it wasn't.

322
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,091
What's the big deal?
Maybe your dad...

323
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,652
just didn't feel
like playing.

324
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,188
Maybe he didn't feel
like playing alone.

325
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,893
[Music playing]

326
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,405
[Sighs] OK. I'm here. What?

327
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:03,739
Mom, this is bad.

328
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,438
Look, there was a father/son

softball game on Saturday.

329
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,878
oh, shocker.

330
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:09,643
You know?

331
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,671
She knows.

332
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:14,118
I don't get it. Why'd Dad
tell us the game was canceled?

333
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,381
Gee, guys, I'm not sure.

334
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,981
Did you give him any indication
that you didn't want to play?

335
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,514
-No way.
-No way.

336
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,221
-We were completely cool.
-Completely cool.

337
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,320
-He knew immediately.
-He knows everything.

338
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,093
obviously he picked up
on the fact...

339
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,463
that you didn't want to play...

340
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,161
and he's the one
who let you off the hook.

341
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,692
Worms.

342
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:31,795
We're worms.

343
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,863
We made our father feel bad.

344
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,840
Mom, can you
get us out of this?

345
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,365
You know,

for old times' sake?

346
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,968
Hmm. Can't.

347
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,911
The fat lady has sung
and gone home.

348
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,006
She's in her kitchen
eating cheesecake.

349
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,482
Come on, Mom.

350
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,417
We made our father feel bad.

351
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,353
Well, he's a big boy.
He'll get over it...

352
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,552
But hopefully you guys learned
something for the next time.

353
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,560
I have. I really have.

354
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,994
Good. Then you
get over it, too.

355
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,793
I can't get over it.

356
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,697
I'll never get over it.

357
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,759
Dad really wanted to play,
and he knew we didn't...

358
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,668
so he dumped the game for us.

359
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,764
It's like
"The Gift of the Magi"...

360
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:10,401
except we didn't
get him anything.

361
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,570
Are we bad sons, Eric?

362
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,307
Right now we are.

363
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,042
I don't feel so good.

364
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,778
I have appendicitis.

365
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,651
That's not your appendix,
that's your heart.

366
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,121
I have ahearticitis.

367
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,160
[Banging]

368
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:35,797
Mr. Matthews. Mr. Matthews.
Leonard Spinelli.

369
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:38,167
I work for your father
down at the grocery store.

370
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:39,569
We know who you are, Lenny.

371
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,629
We're the ones
that called you.

372
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,971
Yeah, I know.

And it was a rare treat...

373
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,943
but, since you never
called me before...

374
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,604
I thought I'd give
you one last chance...

375
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,375
to make sure
you got the right guy.

376
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,177
Did you get the stuff
we asked you for?

377
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,205
Yes, I did.

378
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,377
Then we got the right guy.

379
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,387
oK, let's see.

Ground chuck.

380
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,616
Hamburger buns.

381
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,852
You may be wondering
how I sprained my elbow.

382
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,417
Lenny, we know you got hurt
at the softball game.

383
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,588
What game?

384
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,563
You're not supposed
to know about the game.

385
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:09,864
I hurt myself getting out
of a turtleneck that shrunk.

386
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,597
We know about the game, Lenny.

387
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,867
Just don't let Dad know
we know about the game.

388
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,066
Yeah.

389
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,371
oh, boy. oK, let's recap.

390
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,503
Your father says
there was no game...

391
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,706
but knows there was one.
You know there was a game...

392
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,715
but you don't want
your father to know you know.

393
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,047
Well, let me ask you this--
don't you think he knows...

394
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,885
you know he knows you know
you know he knows, you know?

395
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,891
You got to excuse me,
I'm on painkillers.

396
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,825
Root beer.

397
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,590
Pickles and chips.

398
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,028
You know, this is

the first occasion...

399
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,861
I've ever done myself
physical damage...

400
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,196
that I can remember.

401
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:42,462
Ketchup.

402
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,470
of course, I can remember

many occasions...

403
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,371
when I've done myself
vast emotional damage.

404
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,271
Pimento loaf?

405
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:50,741
Did We ask for this?

406
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,301
No, but I threw that in

'cause I really love it.

407
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,677
What?

408
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:55,874
Now we got everything we need...

409
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,247
for that all-guy party
you described.

410
00:16:58,284 --> 00:16:59,251
Lenny--

411
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,616
About that party, Lenny. See--

412
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,985
Vast emotional damage.

413
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,820
We'd be delighted
if you could attend.

414
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,587
Thank you.
Delighted to be here.

415
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:10,061
I'll go turn off my car.

416
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,696
Is this the best time
you could ever have?

417
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,702
Just cooking burgers
in the backyard...

418
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,135
Dad and his boys...

419
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,400
And his dad's
assistant manager.

420
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,963
Time of my life.

421
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:25,842
I'd applaud, but I'd pass out.

422
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,939
Salad's done.

423
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,849
Good-looking salad.
Real men need a salad...

424
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,409
they can eat
with their hands.

425
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,616
Yeah, you just pick it up
and dunk it in the dressing.

426
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,988
Ah, no dirty dishes...

427
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,549
No napkins, no utensils...

428
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:43,721
When we're finished,

we just hose down the porch.

429
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,196
Man meal. End of story.

430
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,200
Boy, you guys know
how to have a good time.

431
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,599
Someday,
when I have a family...

432
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,034
I'm gonna have a good time.

433
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,698
Unless my wife divorces me
and my kids hate me...

434
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,297
because she poisoned them
against me...

435
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,332
and I have to send
my entire weekly paycheck...

436
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,207
to support
the blood-sucking leeches...

437
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,703
while I live
in squalor and despair.

438
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,239
Did I mention
I'm on painkillers?

439
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,982
Root beers all around?

440
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,818
oh, right.
We're having fun now.

441
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,414
You having a good time, Dad?

442
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,358
Hey, great.
What could be better?

443
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,951
Yeah. What could be better?

444
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:16,962
Yeah.

445
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:19,590
-Could I see you?
-Yeah.

446
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:24,867
He hates it.

447
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,667
He doesn't hate it.
He's having a nice time.

448
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,571
Nice isn't
good enough, Eric.

449
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,940
Remember how psyched he was
about the softball game?

450
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,342
That Was the time
he Wanted.

451
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:34,141
He wanted one lousy
softball game...

452
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,340
and we didn't give it to him.

453
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:36,507
We gave him dinner.

454
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,107
We gave him dinner...

455
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,677
which he's given us, what,
only every night of our lives.

456
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:44,155
We thought it would be
such a big deal.

457
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,181
I guess we should've
just given him the game.

458
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,422
Yeah. We should've just
stepped up to the plate...

459
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,794
and said, "l pledge
allegiance to my dad"...

460
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,924
and swung for that
game-winning home run.

461
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,900
Think that would've
been better than tonight?

462
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:56,959
Hey, you guys.

463
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,493
Come out and get
some pimento loaf.

464
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,334
I just noticed
the expiration date.

465
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,972
oh, yeah.
Much better than tonight.

466
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,649
All right, class, when we were
last in social studies...

467
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,744
We were addressing
the issue of social dissent.

468
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,254
Miss Lawrence?

469
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,848
I've thought over my position,
Mr. Feeny.

470
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,689
And not only do I not want to
say the Pledge of Allegiance...

471
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,628
but I also do not want
to wear shoes.

472
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:28,691
We who sit behind you object.

473
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:32,568
Mr. Matthews, you were
a pro-pledger as I recall.

474
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:35,130
Yeah, I was,

but I thought it over.

475
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,836
oh? You've changed
your position?

476
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:41,608
No. I haven't,

but I can argue it better now.

477
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:45,515
Really? Well, then,
the floor is yours.

478
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,816
At first, I thought
we should just say it...

479
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,418
because it was a tradition,

and it's the flag...

480
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,122
but now I think it's dumb...

481
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,358
to do something and not know
why you do it.

482
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,890
And what conclusion
has that led you to?

483
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,403
That if there's something
you care about...

484
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:08,737
Iike the country you live in
or the father you have...

485
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:12,266
then allegiance,
which means...

486
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,779
"Noun. Loyalty or devotion
to a government...

487
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,180
"or a group or a person."

488
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,049
Allegiance is something
you should show.

489
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:23,487
So, then you believe
that you should respect...

490
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,513
the traditions
of that government...

491
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,287
or group or person.

492
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,351
Yeah. I should've.

493
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,521
or teacher?

494
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,587
[Bell rings]

495
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,611
or a teacher.

496
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,588
Why aren't you guys asleep?

497
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,122
We couldn't sleep, Dad.

498
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,032
We got something
on our minds.

499
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,900
Yeah, and it's really
dragging us down.

500
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,564
oh, come on, guys.
Forget it.

501
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,234
You threw me a barbecue.
We're even.

502
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,209
No. We're way past that guilt.

503
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:21,475
We never found out the score
of the father/son softball game.

504
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:23,641
oh, well, we got creamed.

505
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:24,808
18-3.

506
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,115
You let those sandal-wearing,
crystal-packing...

507
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:31,123
brown rice-eating veg heads
walk all over you?

508
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:33,057
[Laughs]
Hey, I wasn't even there.

509
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:34,559
Well, whose fault

is that?

510
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:35,617
Yours.

511
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,152
-No, it isn't.

-oh, it isn't?

512
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,222
No. Because traditionally...

513
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:42,461
it's the son's part of the game
to not want to go.

514
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:45,197
And it's the father's part
of the game to make us go.

515
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,363
You didn't make us go.

516
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,599
You didn't play the game.

517
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,631
You broke
the tradition, Dad.

518
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,370
And I figure
that's why we lost.

519
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,570
You do?

520
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,045
Yeah, but seeing as
we're bucking tradition...

521
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,672
why do we have to wait
a whole year...

522
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,114

father/son game?

523
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,745
Yeah. How about we challenge
the Unicorn Rainbow Bookstore...

524
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,051

I am free next weekend.

526
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,120
-So are we.
-No matter what we're doing.

527
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,223
All right. We got a game.

530
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,070
-oh, Dad...

-Hmm?

531
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,097
-on one condition.
-What?

532
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:24,837

00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,991
And here's
the game-winning father now.

537
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,518
Great slide
into home, Dad.

538
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,258
Hey, high five.

539
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,492
All right.

540
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,228
Yeah, that was

a great game.

541
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:52,431
I had a terrific time.
I can't wait till next year.

542
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,132
Ah, you don't have to.
That's the best part.

543
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:56,334
Yeah, the bookstore wants to go
best two out of three.

544
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,706
We got a rematch next week.

545
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,711
Hey, that's nice.

546
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,508
