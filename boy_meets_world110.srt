1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,470
"And it was always said
of Scrooge...

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:07,474
"that he knew how
to keep Christmas well...

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,976
"if any man alive
possessed the knowledge.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,674
"May that be truly said of us,
and all of us.

5
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,478
"And so as Tiny Tim observed...

6
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,975
"God bLess us. every one. "

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,854
And so ends Dickens' masterpiece
"A Christmas Carol."

8
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,223
Wait a minute.
Where's the Grinch?

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,820
Yeah. Isn't the Grinch
supposed to show up now...

10
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,831
and, like, take everything?

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,130
How come it's called
"A Christmas Carol" anyway?

12
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,534
Yeah. There was nobody
in this story named Carol.

13
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:42,267
Miss Lawrence, would you please
trade places with Mr. Matthews?

14
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,571
All right.

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,042
I am a hyperactive,
underachieving, 1 1-year-old boy.

16
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,808
I meant physically.

17
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:56,084
oh, well, that takes

less of a psychic toll.

18
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:57,522
Why do I have to move?

19
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,617
We were just giving
our view of the book.

20
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,685
Yeah. I mean,

you say literary masterpiece...

21
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,889
-we say...Anh!
-Anh!

22
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:07,423
Mr. Matthews, I'm less

interested in your review...

23
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,401
than I am that
you understand the material.

24
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,904
What, in your opinion,
was Mr. Dickens...

25
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,567
trying to express
in his Christmas story?

26
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,075
That if
you're a real butthead...

27
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,306
then neat ghosts
will take you to cool places.

28
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,578
Anh!

29
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,912
Fish and sticks.

30
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,415
Two things nature
never would've put together.

31
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,076
What'd you get?

32
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:32,585
Peanut butter and jelly.

33
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,110
Two things
nature couldn't keep apart.

34
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,715
Since when did
your mom pack you lunch?

35
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,191
I thought you liked fish sticks.

36
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,694
I do, but I think it's cruel...

37
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:46,722
how the little fish scream
when they rip their sticks off.

38
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,234
May I sit down?

39
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,667
BOTH: No.

40
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,604
Well, since you're ambivalent.

41
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,106
Ah, Christmas.

42
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,735
Season of togetherness.
Season of brotherhood.

43
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,176
Season of wool.

44
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,679
Nine out of ten
Christmas gifts--wool.

45
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:03,182
It doesn't matter if it's shaped
like socks or a sweater...

46
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,343
it's wool and it's itchy.

47
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,183
The gift isn't as important
as the thought behind it.

48
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,848
What's the thought behind wool?

49
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,824
This kid doesn't scratch enough?

50
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,527
I agree with Stuart.

51
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,529
oh, no. It's a nerd swarm.

52
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,361
Minkus,

shut off your geek magnet.

53
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,026
I just think
we often lose sight...

54
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:24,731
of the true meaning of Christmas
in the frenzy of commercialism.

55
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,204
What are you talking about?

56
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,504
How do We knowWhat to ask for
if We don't have commercials?

57
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,808
Christmas is the celebration
of the winter solstice...

58
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:36,805
an ancient tribal ritual
whose origins are lost in time.

59
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,718
Yeah, we were just talking
about that in the bathroom.

60
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,314
Listen, Topanga,
I think I can hear them...

61
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,722
calling you back
into your own dimension.

62
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,953
oh, yeah. They're saying...

63
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,655
"Topanga,
get your aura back here."

64
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,324
"And bring Minkus."

65
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,296
BOTH: Ha!

66
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:00,204
oK. Christmas tree update.

67
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,437
I think I got my real leather
NBA regulation basketball.

68
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,206
Cool. Major gift.

69
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,405
So major a gift...

70
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,006
I've been saving up
to buy my gift a gift.

71
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,041
What do you get the basketball
who has everything?

72
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:17,216
A $5.00 top of the line
imitation nylon net.

73
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,588
You have five bucks?

74
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,116
I've been saving up for a month.

75
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:23,186
Let's go buy it after school.

76
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,131
No. Then I tip off my parents
that I know what I'm getting.

77
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,498
You are a yuletide master.

78
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,560
Christmas is very delicate.

79
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,265
You screw up--wool.

80
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:36,434
So, what's the update
at your house?

81
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,138
Me? Hey, Bob Stubcheck's
Sports World...

82
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:41,943
has to send over a truck with
all the stuff my dad got me.

83
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,950
He got me, like, everything.

84
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,212
That's great.

85
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,720
Yeah. My dad totally
came through this year.

86
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:51,155
Speaking of gifts, you haven't
yet chipped in your $5.00...

87
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,125
for the class present
to Mr. Feeny.

88
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,128
-Tomorrow.
-You said that yesterday.

89
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,493
Come on, Shawn...

90
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,090
don't think of it
as $5.00 for Feeny's present.

91
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,124
Think of it as five bucks
to make Minkus go away.

92
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,138
Look, Minkus, I just spent
my last money on lunch, oK?

93
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,764
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

94
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,736
What? His mother
charged him a packing fee?

95
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,020
[Sighs]

96
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,191
Hi.

97
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:34,359
Hey! Did you have fun
at the mall?

98
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,631
I don't think I'd call it fun.

99
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,436
Well, hi, pumpkin.
I bet you had fun.

100
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:43,601
Did you get your picture
taken with Santa Claus?

101
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:48,637
Aaah!

102
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,650
I tried to tell you.

103
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,652
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that...

104
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,746
meant "Don't mention Santa."
What happened?

105
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,758
Well, Morgan was waiting
in line to sit on Santa's lap...

106
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,761
and she was kind of nervous,

and there was this elf...

107
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,423
who looked like a hitman,

only meaner.

108
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,931
What? Did Santa scare her?

109
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,332
No, no. He was

just this nice old man...

110
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,630
with a jolly red face.

111
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,604
You know, looking back,
his face really was too red.

112
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,664
I mean I just thought
he was overheated.

113
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,733
Velvet is a fabric
that doesn't breathe.

114
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,141
Amy, what happened?

115
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:21,341
Well, oK, so Morgan climbs up
on Santa's lap...

116
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,643
and he asks her
what she wants...

117
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,115
and she says
a Suzie Homemaker oven...

118
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:29,782
and then he grabbed his chest,
yelled "Rudolph," and fell over.

119
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,061
Are we talking eight reindeer
pulling a pine box?

120
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,066
No, no.

I think he's all right.

121
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,568
I mean, the hitman elf

gave him CPR...

122
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:45,070
while Mrs. Claus called
the paramedics.

123
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,699
Alan, it isn't funny!

124
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,403
Morgan thinks
she killed Santa Claus.

125
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,578
Well, did you tell her
that he's oK?

126
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,980
of course I did.
I said he was just resting...

127
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,348
and he'd be fine.

128
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,785
Maybe you can take her
to visit him in the hospital.

129
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,447
I really don't think
it'll help her to see...

130
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:05,686
Santa Claus with
a tube stuck up his nose.

131
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,090
Hey. What's with the weasel?

132
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,321
She locked herself
in the bathroom...

133
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,726
and she's singing...

134
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,822
&  On the first day
of Christmas &

135
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,355
&  I murdered Santa CLaus &

136
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,530
I'll go check on her. ohh!

137
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,003
Hi, Cory.

138
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,976
Hello, son, apple of my eye.

139
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,504
Dad, there's no reaching him
when he's taking inventory.

140
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,680
Yes! A new arrival!

141
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,584
It's Wool.

142
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,920
You know, Cor,

when I was a kid...

143
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,051
Christmas was about
appreciating your gifts...

144
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,924
because they were given
with love.

145
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,193
Love, right. Glad that's over.

146
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,723
oK. Three new boxes
and only one sounds itchy.

147
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,167
I'm going to go tell Shawn.

148
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,670
Whoa. Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

149
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,172
To call Shawn.

150
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,106
I don't think it'd be
such a good idea...

151
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,870
to exaggerate about the gifts
you're getting.

152
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,208
-I have to just to keep up.
-What do you mean?

153
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,146
I mean, Bob Stubcheck's

Sports World has been moved.

154
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,412
It's new location?
Under Shawn's tree.

155
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:08,046
I think Shawn may have been
exaggerating a little bit.

156
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,555
Dad, it's Christmas.

157
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,056
You're supposed to exaggerate.

158
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:14,117
I'm gonna tell him I got five
new presents under the tree.

159
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,889
You know, I don't think...

160
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,658
Shawn's gonna be having much of
a Christmas this year.

161
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,187
Why not?

162
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:23,828
[Sighs]
Shawn's dad got laid off.

163
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,361
Shawn's dad lost his job?

164
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:29,341
Yeah. I guess he was just
too embarrassed to tell you.

165
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,607
But I'm his best friend.

166
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,944
So that's why
his mom's packing his lunch.

167
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,450
Shawn's not getting anything
for Christmas...

168
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:41,943
just like Tiny Tim
in that story about Carol.

169
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,616
I don't think
it's quite that bad.

170
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,091
Dad, can I give him
one of the presents...

171
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,822
under the tree
so at least he has something?

172
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,727
That'd be really nice, Cor.

173
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:54,165
oK. How about one of Eric's?

174
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,633
MORGAN: &  We wish you
a merry Christmas &

175
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,869
&  We wish you
a merry Christmas &

176
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,639
&  We wish you
a merry Christmas &

177
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,145
Morgan, if you come out...

178
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,648
I'll let you
play with my makeup.

179
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,776
&  And a happy new year &

180
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,913
Morgan, come out.
Santa's fine.

181
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,650
MORGAN: No. he's not.

182
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,352
Well, then how come

he just called me on the phone?

183
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,951
MORGAN: He did?

184
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,155
Yep.

185
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,686
MORGAN: What did he say?

186
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,825
He said,

"Ho ho h--ohh! ohh!"

187
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,357
Stop it.

188
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:33,866
What?

189
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,178
He said you've been
a very, very good girl...

190
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,680
and I should give you something
really special.

191
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,147
MORGAN: Like what?

192
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,650
Whatever you tell her,
she's gonna want it...

193
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,845
the second you open that door.

194
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:51,952
How about my new flannel shirt
that you like so much?

195
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,727
oK.

196
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,099
Ta-da!

197
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,469
What?

198
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:07,973
For you.

199
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,201
What is it?

200
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,210
open it. For you from me.

201
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,109
It's not going to blow up,
is it?

202
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,273
open it! open it!

203
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,306
Here. Let me open it.

204
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:26,216
A real leather NBA certified...

205
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,591
dribbles like a dream
basketball!

206
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,120
I'm giving it to you.
Don't you love me?

207
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,793
Why'd you give this to me?

208
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,269
Because it's Christmas.

209
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,864
So? We never give each other
stuff for Christmas.

210
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,967
Yeah, but this year's
kind of different.

211
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,272
Why?

212
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,041
Well...because.

213
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,311
Because why?

214
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,875
Because you're my best friend.

215
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,410
But I wasn't last year.

216
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:58,356
No, you were, it's just--

217
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,318
Cory, best friends
don't lie to each other.

218
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:08,926
oK. Look, Shawn, I gave you this
because I didn't think...

219
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,663
you'd be getting
that many gifts this year.

220
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:14,662
Hey, I told you.
I'm getting a ton of stuff.

221
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:18,609
I don't need a basketball.
My dad already got me two.

222
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:22,342
Look, Shawn, best friends

don't lie to each other.

223
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,612
What are you talking about?

224
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,950
I know about
your dad getting laid off.

225
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,852
-Says who?
-Says my dad.

226
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,381
oh, so what'd you do,
go tell everyone?

227
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,394
No. I didn't tell anyone.

228
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,726
Look, Shawn, I'm trying
to give you a nice gift...

229
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,823
so you don't have
a Tiny Tim Christmas...

230
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,527
and you're acting like
you're mad at me.

231
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,058
oh, so I'm supposed
to be all happy...

232
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,434
that you gave me
some bogus gift?

233
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:49,100
That's not a bogus gift.
That's a totally major gift.

234
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,336
It was my best gift...

235
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,037
and I was nice enough
to give it to you.

236
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,978
Yeah. Well, keep it.

237
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,674
I don't want your basketball.

238
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,615
Wouldn't you rather have
something for Christmas...

239
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,117
than nothing at all?

240
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,312
I'd rather have nothing
for Christmas...

241
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,446
than your lousy charity.

242
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,184
Hey, Shawn,
Christmas is about charity.

243
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,216
You should be thanking me!

244
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,197
Boy, where's
his Christmas spirit?

245
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,859
Where's his gratitude?

246
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,868
I can name one sixth grader...

247
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,200
who wasn't paying attention
to "A Christmas Carol."

248
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,865
I can name one, too,

Mr. Matthews.

249
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,238
-Yeah, Shawn.

-Cory.

250
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,209
Ha ha! No, I'm Cory.

251
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,712
You've been calling me
Mr. Matthews for so long...

252
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,044
you must've forgot.

253
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:32,051
Believe me,

I know who you are.

254
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:36,681
I also know that a true gift
is given with no expectation.

255
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,384
What's that mean?

256
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,588
It means you gave the gift
to get the thanks.

257
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:47,191
I gave the guy my official NBA
genuine leather basketball...

258
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,224
and he threw it back in my face.

259
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,669
What kind of friend is that?

260
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,229
You know what
I like most about Christmas?

261
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,640
I go away for a week?

262
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:59,668
Yeah, that's pretty special.

263
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:03,671
But it's the time of year
that you can think back...

264
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:07,914
and appreciate
the real gifts you received.

265
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,888
I don't get it.

266
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:13,187
Friendship, for example,
is a real gift.

267
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:16,195
And it's given
with no expectation...

268
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,697
and no gratitude is necessary.

269
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:22,292
Not between real friends.

270
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,734
You think about that.

271
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:34,709
[Sighs] We finally got Morgan
out of the bathroom.

272
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,113
-Great. How'd you do it?
-Psychology.

273
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,948
And bribery.

274
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,080
What happened to that mean elf?

275
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:46,353
oh, he went back

to the North Pole with Santa.

276
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,383
I think he Was mad at me.

277
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,487
No. He wasn't mad at you.

278
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,988
Then how come
he called me a demon child?

279
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,400
Well, he's gone now
and you don't ever...

280
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:58,699
have to worry about him
ever, ever again.

281
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,205
[Knock on door]

282
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,604
-I'll get it.
-Thank you.

283
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:11,474
Aaah!

284
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,712
-Mr. Matthews?
-Yeah?

285
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:14,981
I'm the elf.

286
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,648
No kidding.

287
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,520
I came to return
your wife's money.

288
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,219
She paid for a picture
with Santa.

289
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,419
She never got it.

290
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,928
Uh, excuse me.

291
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:26,022
You called my little girl
a demon child?

292
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,329
Hey, all I know
is one minute...

293
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,700
Santa's all jolly,
jingling his bells...

294
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,534
the next minute,

your kid sits on his lap...

295
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,735
ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom!
Heart attack.

296
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,211
Coincidence?
I don't think so.

297
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:44,613
ELF: Yeah? Merry stinking
Christmas to you. too. paL!

298
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,253
Shawn, it's tomorrow.

299
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,457
What are you talking about?

300
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,262
I'm talking
about the class present.

301
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,995
You still haven't paid
your $5.00.

302
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,595
Fine, I'll give it to you.
I just don't have it on me.

303
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,731
I'm going to buy
the present tonight...

304
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:10,334
so today is the last day
to give me the money.

305
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,606
I said I'll give it to you.

306
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,307
If you don't give me
$5.00 right now...

307
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,077
I'm not going to put your name
on the card...

308
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,710
and the entire sixth grade
of Jefferson Elementary...

309
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,220
is going to know
you're a deadbeat.

310
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,048
Fine, then I am. oK?

311
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,623
Minkus, leave him alone.

312
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,132
He doesn't have the money.

313
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,135
-He doesn't?
-No.

314
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:39,696
oh. That puts me in
an awkward position.

315
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,172
I can't put his name
on the card...

316
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,175
if he doesn't give me
the money.

317
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:44,676
Rules are rules.

318
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,178
I'm the class treasurer,

an elected official.

319
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,909
They could subpoena my diaries.

320
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,747
Um, look...

321
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,845
a couple weeks ago,
Shawn lent me five bucks...

322
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,379
and I never paid him back.

323
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,686
That's why
he doesn't have the money.

324
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,159
oh, so you're the deadbeat.

325
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:07,724
Yeah. But I've got it now,
so here it is.

326
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:12,727
Just make sure you put
Shawn's name on the card, oK?

327
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,740
Don't worry.
His name, however...

328
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,641
will have to be last since
he was the last one to pay.

329
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:21,204
Gee, Minkus, I wonder

whose name is first on the list?

330
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,579
Does it rhyme with stinkus?

331
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,221
I hope our reading
"A Christmas Carol"...

332
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,848
has interested all of you...

333
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,916
in reading other works
by Charles Dickens.

334
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,986
No, but I will watch

the David Copperfield special.

335
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,657
Mr. Minkus.

336
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,463
In my capacity
as class treasurer...

337
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,470
I Would like to present you...

338
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,472
with the sixth grade's
Christmas gift.

339
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,441
oh, my. Well...

340
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,467
ooh, it has the lovely heft
of a thick book.

341
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,878
You cunning bibliophile, you.

342
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,440
oh, my!

343
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,976
A dictionary.
How wonderful.

344
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:06,219
"To our admired
and respected teacher...

345
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:09,160
"from his dutiful
and attentive class."

346
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,662
I Wrote that.

Your deadbeat friend...

361
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,432
finally paid back
the money he owed you.

It's oK. You don't have
to cover for him anymore.

364
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,075
He told me
how you lent him $5.00...

365
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,474
and he didn't give it back.

366

Cory told you that?

367

Yep, and he handed me
five bucks.

He gave you his $5.00?

finally got the better of him.

A net!

378
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,597
It belonged to my dad.
It's real old...

379
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,831
so it might not be
genuine imitation nylon.

380
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,864
Whoa, if it's that old,

it could be actual nylon!

381

and I got the ball.

What ball?

385
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,309

this back in my face.

from me, aren't you?
