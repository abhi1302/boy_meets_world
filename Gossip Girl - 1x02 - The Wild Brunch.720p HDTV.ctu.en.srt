00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
Gossip girl here...

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,320
 your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,380
You got into Brown.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,790
- The letter came while you were away.  - Congratulations. 

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,350
You said you could call in a favor at N.Y.U. Did you mean it? 

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,740
I can only get you an interview.

7
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,450
It's gonna be up to you to wow him. 

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,040
You got your money. That's all that matters.

9
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:19,290
- Now you can go to...  - I'm going to N.Y.U. Now.

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,680
Great. Then I'll see you next year. 

11
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,190
Oh, my god. You're Nate Archibald.

12
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,030
And you're Bree Buckley. It's good to see you again.

13
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,410
I made some new friends, one in particular.

14
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,000
Oh. So you are dating someone?

15
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:28,790
His name's Scott, and I think you guys

16
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,610
 Would really like each other.

17
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,770
Yeah, mom, everything's great.

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,480
I have been waiting all summer for reed to start,

19
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,610
 And tomorrow's the day I get to do what I came here for.

20
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,870
I know secrecy is a lot to ask for,

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,720
- But I really can't risk making my family more upset right now.  - Don't worry.

22
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,320
 I'm good at secret relationships. 

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,680
What if your dad didn't want to see you? Who cares?

24
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,400
Who the hell is he not to want you?

25
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,430
 I would've stayed all summer with you. 

26
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,390
Vanessa, I'm... I'm not changing.

27
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,020
I don't care if you're rich, which you aren't, by the way.

28
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,490
If you're gonna be in this world, be yourself in this world.

29
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,140
Is there anything else?  

30
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,480
I'd like to request a roommate... Blair Waldorf.

31
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,960
She's my best friend, and I just can't wait to live with her.

32
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,650
And who am I?

33
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,100
That's a secret I'll never tell.

34
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,810
You know you love me.

35
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,540
X.o.x.o. Gossip Girl.

36
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,410
Every fall, confident high school seniors

37
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,450
transform into nervous college freshmen.

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,270
They leave their parents' homes

39
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,910
for the hallowed halls of higher education.

40
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,150
And like any new venture,

41
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,180
starting college holds the promise

42
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,660
Of limitless opportunity.

43
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,490
The opportunity to conquer a new territory...

44
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,490
* The facts and the figures *

45
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,500
* They overwhelm and stifle *

46
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,140
* Everything *

47
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,240
* That you thought you knew *

48
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,790
Or to try and be a little less lonely...

49
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,030
* The facts and the figures *

50
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,830
* They overwhelm and stifle *

51
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,370
But just because the opportunity

52
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,500
presents itself...

53
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,500
* That you think make a difference *

54
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,460
Doesn't mean everybody is ready to take it.

55
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,420
Mmm.

56
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,500
You're so sweet to see me off.

57
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,020
I can't believe N.Y.U. orientation week. is finally here.

58
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,980
I have to object to you living in the dorms.

59
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,680
Fluorescent lighting, communal showers,

60
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,070
Public school girls?

61
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,730
There's a place for that,

62
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,680
and it belongs in the back of a video store. 

63
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,130
It's not for long.

64
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,520
I can't rule the N.Y.U. Masses from the upper east side.

65
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,230
I need to spend time in the dorm to establish myself as queen.

66
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,820
It's not Constance, Blair.

67
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,380
The only queens at N.Y.U.

68
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,070
are the ones with tickets to see Liza at carnegie hall.

69
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,500
Chuck, I trust that when you say,

70
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,420
"never drink absinthe with Daniel Baldwin,"

71
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,740
You know what you're talking about.

72
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,970
But when I say the first week of college means.

73
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,830
Scared, vulnerable freshmen needing someone to guide them,

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,460
That I know what I'm talking about.

75
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,730
And I'm very excited for you.

76
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,480
- So you haven't called Vanessa yet?  - No, she's the one who's out of line.

77
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,530
- She's gotta call me.  - Or you could just get over it. After all these years, You guys are finally gonna be at the same school.

78
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,000
I guess you're right. It's probably not the best idea To be avoiding my only friend at N.Y.U.

79
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,300
For the record, Dan, I don't think You're gonna have any trouble making friends there.

80
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,055
Right, because the...

81
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:24,200
The world of greenwich village intelligentsia

82
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,750
is Dan Humphrey's natural habitat.

83
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,480
You're so lucky. N.Y.U. is exactly the right place for you.

84
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,240
Like Brown is for you.

85
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,540
Serena?

86
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:36,890
Um...

87
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,170
Sorry. Uh, yeah.

88
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,720
You know what? I should finish packing.

89
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,420
But good luck, Dan.

90
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,220
Hey, I'm sorry.

91
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,010
Are you Dan Humphrey?

92
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,420
Uh, yeah. Like the Dan Humphrey who was published

93
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,150
In the "20 under 20" issue of "the new yorker"?

94
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,460
Uh, yeah. 

95
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,230
Large coffee, please.

96
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,570
I'm Katie, and I'm not usually an eavesdropping stalker.

97
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,740
It's just that I read your piece, and it was amazing.

98
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,780
What? Really? Wow. That's... that... thank you.

99
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,780
Yeah, well, at first I hated you because I also submitted,

100
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,010
But then I read it and I was like,

101
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,770
Okay, fine. I accept defeat at your hands, Dan Humphrey.

102
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,280
Anyway, I have a writer's group. We meet every week.

103
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,670
We're meeting here at noon tomorrow. You should come.

104
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,890
Car's downstairs. You ready?

105
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,390
- As I'll ever be.  - Today's a big day,

106
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,060
You and Dan both off college.

107
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,020
Yeah, I know. I know.

108
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,810
Uh, I should get going.

109
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,180
Your mom's so proud of you.

110
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,220
So am I.

111
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:10,920
Hey.

112
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,780
Uh, Scott, you remember Dan. Dan, this is Scott.

113
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,550
Yeah. No, it's, uh, it's good to finally officially meet you. 

114
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,600
Uh, so are you two dating now?  Last I heard you were just friends

115
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,830
 Yeah, you actually have to call me to find out what's going on in my life. 

116
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,470
 Oh, well, okay. I didn't realize we were speaking.

117
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,990
- Oh, god.  - Of course she's in a limo.

118
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,240
Ew.

119
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,910
Let's make it clear from the start.

120
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,690
We don't know each other here.

121
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,350
- Works for me.  - Me, too.

122
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,240
Well, hello, sis.

123
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,800
I assume you need a few ounces of study aid for Brown.

124
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,280
No. I need a place to stay.

125
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,270
I'm not going to Brown.

126
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,490
Yes, we may all be freshmen and new to N.Y.U.and the dorms,

127
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,530
 but that doesn't mean We have to embarrass ourselves.

128
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,340
I can tell from looking around this room that none of you are from new york city.

129
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,330
 Actually, I'm from...

130
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:16,950
Riverdale doesn't count. 

131
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,570
Anyway, I won't be holding The sad truths of your hometowns against you.

132
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,110
In fact, I want to help you. 

133
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,940
For example, who can tell me Which is the only club to be seen at on a saturday night?  

134
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,120
I read marquee.

135
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,270
Wrong. You should never be seen at a club on a saturday night.

136
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,100
It's strictly bridge and tunnel on the weekends.

137
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,150
You're welcome. Now Dorota and I have put together some gift bags

138
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,850
 filled with essentials for everyone.  

139
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,230
I think you don't need week to run school.

140
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,500
You do it in one day.

141
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,890
I know. This is going even better than I'd hoped.

142
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,000
 And the best part is I seem to have a single.

143
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,260
Sorry I'm late.

144
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,340
Blair?

145
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,440
Blair Waldorf? Oh, my gosh! 

146
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,290
Oh, my gosh. I can't believe it! We're roommates! 

147
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,460
Rah rah, sis boom bah.

148
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,720
Georgina's pulled a coup date.

149
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,480
Welcome to college, b.

150
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,280
This is gonna be a blast.

151
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,390
Following me to N.Y.U.? Becoming my roommate?

152
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,630
I'm gonna have Dorota file a restraining order.

153
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,990
I mean, you're overreacting.

154
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,600
The roommate thing is just a coincidence.

155
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,670
Besides, my parents said it was either bible camp or college,

156
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,590
- So go, bobcats!  - So you're not in love with jesus anymore?

157
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,010
Oh, I still hold him in my heart,

158
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,280
 But jesus and I have redefined our relationship. 

159
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,230
 You mean he dumped you because he found out you were satan!

160
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,270
This could actually be a good thing, Blair.

161
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,290
Look. Manolos. Size 7, just like you.

162
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,680
 Let me know if you want to borrow.  

163
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,260
I'll win, you know.

164
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,590
I ruled at constance and I will rule here,

165
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,500
- And you can't stand in my way.  - Are you still playing this tired old game?

166
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,950
Oh, please. Like you're not? 

167
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,230
No, I'm not. I'm actually here for a fresh start.

168
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,650
Oh, no. Vanessa, you're in our dorm, too? Yay!

169
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,350
Your dorm? Yeah, um, my room's just down the hall.

170
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,650
So, uh...

171
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,180
That's awesome.

172
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,550
Oh!

173
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,430
Isn't this so pretty?

174
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,930
I'm gonna hang it up.

175
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,670
* The facts and the figures *

176
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,540
* They overwhelm and stifle *

177
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,830
Oh, Miss Blair.

178
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,610
What are we going to do? Call police?

179
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,780
No.

180
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,200
We're going to throw a party.

181
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,010
I go to Masa, see if they will cater.

182
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:34,980
Pardon me.

183
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,140
I was packing and talking to Blair about her classes,

184
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,970
And then it hit me.

185
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,630
I wasn't excited about any of it.

186
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,190
I don't know what I want to do yet,

187
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,580
And... and going off to a new place to figure that out?

188
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,020
I don't know. I'm just... I'm not ready for that.

189
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,030
Look, sis, for people like us,

190
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,200
A college degree is just an accessory,

191
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,630
Like a Malawi baby or a poodle.

192
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,420
Well, it's an accessory my mother really wants me to have.

193
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,240
So you want to hide out at the Bass cave

194
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,200
 until you figure it out. 

195
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,810
Yeah, if it's okay with you. Nobody knows about this,Not even Blair.

196
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,920
 Blair would be even more upset than my mother.

197
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,980
I couldn't help but notice you and Carter Baizen

198
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,530
At the Van Der Bilt Polo party.

199
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,850
This doesn't have anything to do with him, does it?

200
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,530
 No, absolutely not. I haven't even seen him since then.  

201
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,790
Good. Just one favor.

202
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,400
I'm having a meeting here tonight,

203
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,800
 So if you can clear out for a few hours. 

204
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,970
Chuck, I don't mind if your dealer comes by.

205
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,440
Jesse is in St. Barths this week.

206
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,950
This is something more legitimate.

207
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,930
You know the old art deco bank

208
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,950
On 72nd between Madison and park?

209
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,550
The one that went under last month?

210
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,450
I want to make it into a speakeasy.

211
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,530
In the front an elegant restaurant,

212
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,050
But down in the vault,

213
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,210
an after hours locale,

214
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,480
devoted to indecency,

215
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,510
disreputable behavior and all manner of debauchery.

216
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,940
A kind of homage to the last time the market crashed.

217
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:12,950
The harder the times,

218
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,930
The harder people want to party and forget about it.

219
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,220
Chuck. This is really a great idea.

220
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,290
I... I can't believe Blair hasn't told me about this yet.

221
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,030
She doesn't know. Nobody does.

222
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,000
I just wanted to wait till I was sure it was going through.

223
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,320
You know, my father turned his first profit

224
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,700
by the time he was 22.

225
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,910
I hope to do it by the time I'm 21.

226
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,470
* It's a fragile world *

227
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,330
* Susceptible to... *

228
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,470
Let me guess.

229
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,400
Uh, women in literature, professor Schweik?

230
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,690
You know I'm a sucker for stories about scorned women.

231
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,280
I got the same. I think the universe is trying to tell us something.

232
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,100
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I should have called you.

233
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,230
No, it's... it's okay.

234
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,950
I wouldn't have wanted to call me either

235
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,570
After the way I came down on you at the party.

236
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,350
Um... So... Scott?

237
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,560
Yeah, he's... he's so great,

238
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,180
And he really wants to get to know you.

239
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,990
Oh, my god. I have so much to tell you.

240
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,700
 You are never gonna guess who lives in my dorm. 

241
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,470
Hey, guys.

242
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,830
- Oh. Oh!  - Sorry to interrupt. I just saw you, and I thought, um...

243
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,360
So I really just want to apologize

244
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,780
for everything that happened in the past.

245
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,460
I've got my meds straightened out,

246
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,940
And I'm really in a much better place now.

247
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,000
So I come to N.Y.U. hoping for a fresh start,

248
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,050
- And who do I get as my roommate? Blair Waldorf.  - What?

249
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:38,850
- I told you we have so much to catch up on.  - I mean, I wish I had some other friends here, you know?

250
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,570
You guys are... are really lucky to have each other.

251
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,620
Anyway, I should go.

252
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,560
Okay, this is probably too much,

253
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,980
But would you guys want to have a cup of coffee with me?

254
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,490
Uh...

255
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,780
Look, Georgina,

256
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,980
I appreciate that you want a clean slate,

257
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:05,050
but I think it would kind of be too much. I'm sorry.

258
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,790
No, of course.

259
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,580
I... I mean, I... I totally understand.

260
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,610
I'd feel the same way. I'll see you around.

261
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,900
Maybe we were a little bit too harsh.

262
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,600
- What? It's... it's Georgina.  - And you're Dan.

263
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,420
 And you're Vanessa. This is a fun game.  

264
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,270
I'm sorry. I just thought you were A little bit more forgiving than that.

265
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,240
Are you... are you really trying to make me the bad guy here?

266
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,190
No, it's just we want a fresh start and... and so does she.

267
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,030
Okay. I know you're new to the whole school thing,

268
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,450
But you don't want Georgina as your friend.

269
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,080
I mean, she's gonna scare everyone away.

270
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,030
- Georgina.  - Hey.

271
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,050
What's gonna happen next week when we start classes?

272
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,420
That's why we have my family's apartment.

273
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,860
And plus, you know, all this sneaking around,

274
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,510
making sure the doorman doesn't see you,

275
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,130
not answering the phone when my mother calls...

276
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,730
I mean, you know it adds a layer of hotness. 

277
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,560
What are you saying? That our hotness is only purely circumstantial.

278
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,040
And that if we were out in the real world,

279
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,890
We'd like each other less?

280
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,490
Mm. You know that if we really started dating,

281
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,760
after a few months,

282
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,890
you'd realize that you hate the way that I laugh,

283
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,450
I couldn't stand the way that you chew,

284
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,460
And then we'd break up.

285
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,580
That's a very romantic story, you know,

286
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,280
But... It doesn't have to be like that.

287
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,580
Care to make a bet? I got an idea.

288
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,590
I will hole up with you for the next 24 hours,

289
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,030
and we can fast-forward through the entire relationship.

290
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,450
Leave the seat up, sing Timberlake in the shower.

291
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,180
Ah, watch TV shows you really like

292
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,460
As opposed to ones you're supposed to like?

293
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:46,570
What do you say... you, me, this apartment?

294
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,180
Let's get sick of each other.

295
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,440
Okay.

296
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,080
As you can see, the restaurant would be elegant.

297
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,130
Seasonal menu, extensive wine list.

298
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,970
You know, the space is big,

299
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,230
But I want it to have a more intimate feel.

300
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,160
And how would you be using the vault space?

301
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,180
It's perfect for storage.

302
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,620
I have to be honest.

303
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,970
Give your reputation, when you made your bid,

304
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,320
the board was very concerned.

305
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,610
I completely understand.

306
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,750
The neighbors don't want some raucous club coming in

307
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,050
and disrupting the quiet. And believe me,

308
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,890
I wouldn't want to bring that element to the area.

309
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,580
I'll be right down. Ok, I got it.

310
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,340
I got it. Sorry. I'm not here.

311
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,390
My heel broke.

312
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,340
Stepsister. I apologize. 

313
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,610
My lawyer. Excuse me.

314
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,480
Sorry for interrupting your meeting.

315
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,450
Not at all. We were just finishing up anyway.

316
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,070
Oh, are you... are you leasing Chuck the bank space?

317
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:47,940
Mm-hmm.

318
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,600
He has a real vision.

319
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,590
I know. Turning the vault into a club, it's genius.

320
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,600
Serena.

321
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,370
Excuse me?

322
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,330
Thank you.

323
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,420
Cool party. I'm Amalia.

324
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,450
I'm glad people understand the concept of being fashionably late,

325
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,660
But this is ridiculous. 

326
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,660
I think everybody's Down the hall, watching a movie or something.

327
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,690
What?

328
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,780
Please.

329
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,130
Ease up on the toro.

330
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,180
He has to answer to a board, Serena.

331
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,490
And board members tend not to approve

332
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,140
of clubs with coat check girls who give happy endings.

333
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,870
It was an honest mistake.

334
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,280
When he was talking about your plans...

335
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,320
Look, why do you think I asked you to go out tonight?

336
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,530
Because I knew something like this would happen.

337
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,720
Fine. Then I'll go.

338
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,400
Train wreck.

339
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,610
Great job, Vanessa.

340
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,750
That was awesome.

341
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,140
Oh. Hey, Blair.

342
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,750
Oh, my god. We just finished watching Vanessa's documentary

343
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,000
about this community garden in her neighborhood.

344
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,030
- It was amazing.  - No, it wasn't.

345
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,870
Yes, it was. I... I mean, Vanessa, tears. Actual tears.

346
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,290
 When that gang member picked up his first carrot...   

347
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,340
okay, screening is over.

348
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,140
The cocktail party has officially begun

349
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,010
in the common room. Sake-tinis.

350
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,470
And is that my invitation being used as a coaster?

351
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,810
Um, thanks so much, Blair,

352
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,310
But we actually just scarfed, like, four pizzas,

353
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,600
And Vanessa's about to show us

354
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,060
 Her bootleg Michel Gondry videos. 

355
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:01,680
Georgina, please. Nobody wants greasy pizza and Vanessa's home movies

356
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,990
when there's a sushi and sake party right in the other room.

357
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,520
Did I mention wasabi facials?

358
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:12,980
Okay, then.

359
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,000
And shut the door?

360
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:20,860
Spotted Blair Waldorf going from V.I.P. to V.D.

361
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,000
Poor Blair. How are you going to cure this one?

362
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,880
Morning.

363
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:32,860
Hey.

364
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,530
Thanks for letting me crash here last night.

365
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,350
Harboring an ivy league fugitive? I'm your man.

366
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,960
I made you breakfast.

367
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,900
I have to go, but remember, we don't have any servants here,

368
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,550
So if you see anybody else in the loft besides me,

369
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,270
Call the police. It's not the chef.

370
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,380
Good to know.

371
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,710
So did classes start already?

372
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,290
Uh, no, just orientation stuff.

373
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,140
But, uh, i did join a literary group.

374
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,660
More people have talked to me at N.Y.U. In one day

375
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,660
Than my entire four years at St. Jude's.  

376
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,740
Well, i'm not surprised.

377
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,670
I can totally see why people would love you there.   

378
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,450
Oh, about Brown... Uh, you really should think about talking to my dad.

379
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,710
He might ramble a lot, he might nervously strum his guitar,

380
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,330
But, uh, when it comes to fatherly advice,

381
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,100
I don't know, he's pretty much the best there is.

382
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,630
- Do you want one?  - Thanks.

383
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,070
Come to the party. Come to the party. Thanks.

384
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,250
- It's gonna be really fun.  - We'll be there.

385
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,100
Oh, fantastic.

386
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,580
Oh.

387
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,850
So if you're not trying to sabotage me, then what is this?

388
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,500
First you deliberately ruin my sushi party,

389
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,650
And now you're making your move. 

390
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,470
This paranoia has got to stop, Blair.

391
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,190
I am not paranoid. I'm right.

392
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,130
Why else would you have formed an alliance with Vanessa,

393
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,740
 The one person I may hate more than you? 

394
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,550
It's not an alliance. It's a friendship.

395
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,730
Unlike you, Vanessa's cool and people like her,

396
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,010
More than the weird girl who threw the fish party.

397
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,510
Sushi. There was toro.

398
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,120
Face it, Blair.

399
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,220
Once upon a time, in a far-off land,

400
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,360
You were a queen.

401
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,300
Here you're just a loser who will never fit in.

402
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,430
So you won't be needing that.

403
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,820
Hey, guys. Do you want to come to my party?

404
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,530
- You can have one, too. You're really pretty.  - Thank you.

405
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
Rufus?

406
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,260
Hello?

407
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,190
What are you doing here?

408
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,920
Rufus and I were just catching up.

409
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,590
But I have to prepare for a meeting tonight.

410
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,590
Thank you for the waffles.

411
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,460
Look, I...

412
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,620
I don't know what kind of twisted spin

413
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,220
Chuck put on things,

414
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,960
But I actually wanted to talk to you about this.

415
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,690
- Rufus, I'm having doubts about going to Brown.  - Well, I'm sorry about that,

416
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,460
But to lie about leaving for college?

417
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,990
I mean, between the show you put on for the paparazzI all summer

418
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,920
And the craziness at the polo party last week and this,

419
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,390
I don't know what's going on with you.

420
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,320
- I know. I'm sorry I lied. I just didn't want to upset my mom.  - Well, at least we agree about that,

421
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,020
Which is why you can repack your things and go to Brown today.

422
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,690
I'll have a car here within an hour.

423
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,660
As long as you're in it, there's no reason

424
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,990
- Lily ever has to know about this.  - Or what, you'll tell on me?

425
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,690
Wow. I feel really emotionally supported

426
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,520
- in making this life-changing decision.  - It's not a decision. It's a mistake,

427
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,420
- which is why I'm--I'm trying to get you not to make it.  - By threatening me.

428
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,590
Do you know you're more afraid of my mother than I am?

429
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,460
You know what, Rufus? Go ahead. Call her.

430
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,060
You can let her know I'm not going to Brown.

431
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,820
Thanks for the talk.

432
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,490
What do you want?

433
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,760
Hey. I was wondering if you want to go out tonight.

434
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,660
- I thought you were at Brown.  - No, I'm not.

435
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,020
In fact, after I hang up with you,

436
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,060
I will be withdrawing my admission.

437
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,390
There's nobody I'd rather celebrate with.

438
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,260
So are you in or out?

439
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,720
See you tonight.

440
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,360
No, I'm telling you,

441
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,760
I learned everything I need to know about women

442
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,320
From Judy Blume's "Forever."

443
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,720
Can I talk to you?

444
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,420
Uh, yeah. Yeah. What's up?

445
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,160
I was wondering...

446
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,060
Do you have a date to Georgina's party?

447
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,890
Forget the four horsemen.

448
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,920
The real evidence our world is coming to an end...

449
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,190
Blair Waldorf needing Dan Humphrey

450
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,860
To rescue her from social extinction.

451
00:22:15,332 --> 00:22:16,332
You OK?

452
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,160
I just feel like I got off on the wrong foot here,

453
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,920
And I want to start again.

454
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,760
So... Thanks for bringing me,Humphrey.

455
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,760
Oh. Uh,yeah. Well,you know,I... I would just like to think

456
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,590
That if I needed it, somebody would do the same for me.

457
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,690
Although, let's be honest, we both know it wouldn't be you.

458
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,790
Oh.

459
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,890
No headbands in college,okay?

460
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:47,260
* She was so shy *

461
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,990
* Till I drove her wild *

462
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,560
* I make them good girls go bad *

463
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,120
* I make them good girls... *

464
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,420
- Katie.  - Hey,guys.

465
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,790
Blair, you, uh, you remember Katie?

466
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,420
Yeah. Cute necklace.

467
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,590
Thank you. I love your...

468
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,190
How... how about I get us all drinks and you two talk?

469
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,520
Just not about high school, please.

470
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,020
What's up, Dan?

471
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,020
So was everyone at your high school

472
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:20,090
Totally jealous of Dan for being such a great writer?

473
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,390
Dan's a writer?

474
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,720
She was so shy

475
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,120
Till I drove her wild

476
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,760
Oh. Hey, Dan.

477
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,320
Hey. Um,listen. I'm sorry about yesterday.

478
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,060
I... I was out of line.

479
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,060
Please don't... don't even worry about it.

480
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,320
I mean,you have every right to be upset.

481
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,760
- I'm just really glad you're here.  - Thanks.

482
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,860
Okay,so am I really drunk,

483
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,460
Or did I just see you walk in with Blair?

484
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,590
Look, you wanted me to give you a second chance.

485
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,620
Don't you think you should give one to Blair?

486
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,520
She's not looking for a second chance.

487
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,820
She's looking for a way in.

488
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,920
People like you here, Dan, and Blair sees that.

489
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,660
I'm sorry. I've been the person not welcome at parties, 

490
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,660
And if I'm now on the other side of things, 

491
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,520
I'm... I'm not gonna treat people the way I was treated, 

492
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,390
- Even if it's Blair.  - I'm just trying to look out for you.

493
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,720
Trust me. You're being used.

494
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,390
Have fun.

495
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,160
* Oh *

496
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,060
* Yeah *

497
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,760
* Good girls go *

498
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,020
Gross!

499
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,320
With your mother's L.L. Bean catalog?

500
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,420
Ugh. A cargo short fetish

501
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,490
Definitely goes in the "minus" column.

502
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,190
What are you talking about? I was, like, 12 years old.

503
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,190
Speaking of pants, pass yours over here.

504
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,190
- What do you need my pants for?  - Because I want to see what's in them.

505
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,160
Come on. Show me all your secrets.

506
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,360
Have a look. It's just normal stuff.

507
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,020
- Normal stuff, huh? All right.  - See?

508
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,960
Hmm?

509
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,490
Keys, cell phone.

510
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,090
A boarding pass...

511
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,960
From London.

512
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,760
Don't tell me

513
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,220
that you've been wearing these pants since we met, 

514
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,360
because that really would be gross.

515
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,620
No, I... If you must know, I kept it.

516
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,720
Ah.

517
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,290
And he has a sentimental streak.

518
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,860
Hey, I thought your theory was that

519
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,820
If we really got to know each other, we'd break up.

520
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,960
Mm.

521
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,690
Maybe I'm revising my theory.

522
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,020
* You were a problem child. *

523
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,620
To you. Brown's loss is my gain.

524
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,290
Thank you.

525
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,260
You know, when you called, I tried not to answer.

526
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,220
Great. Chuck Bass.

527
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,890
- Let's get out of here.  - No. Come on.

528
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,290
Since when do you run away from Chuck Bass ?

529
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,120
It looks like he's having a business meeting.

530
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,460
This could be fun.

531
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,460
* You're a hot mess *

532
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,760
No way.

533
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,290
Serena, Carter, this isn't a good time.

534
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,490
Well, then let's make it one.

535
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,960
- What's wrong, Chuck? Aren't you happy to see us?  - You know, Carter and I were

536
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,620
Just sharing our favorite Chuck Bass stories.

537
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,820
There were so many we had to break them into categories.

538
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,420
- What were we up to, international affairs?  - Oh, there was a time when, uh, Chuck

539
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,460
And the Italian Ambassador's son

540
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,590
Were asked to leave an Amsterdam brothel.

541
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,490
- Now that's an accomplishment.  - Simple misunderstanding. None of us spoke any Dutch.

542
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,290
Oh! My gosh. Is this... is this a business meeting?

543
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,960
I'm... I'm  sorry if you sense any tension.

544
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,190
Those two don't like each other that much

545
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,260
'Cause they share the same taste in women.

546
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,320
- Sometimes they share the actual women.  - That's enough.

547
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,660
So what's this business meeting about, Bass?

548
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,490
- Still trying to fill your daddy's shoes?  - Yeah, Chuck, come on. Tell him your idea.

549
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,390
- I'm opening a restaurant.  - Yeah, that's what he's telling people, 

550
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,890
But downstairs, in the vault, he's creating a club.

551
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,060
What did you say? You wanted to redefine decadence?

552
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,660
You wanted to ruin my deal, 

553
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,520
So you came here and brought Carter Baizen as your wingman.

554
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,490
I told Rufus about Brown

555
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,620
Because I was actually concerned for you.

556
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,390
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.

557
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,490
Are you insane? "battlestar" kicks "T.N.G." ' ass.

558
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,490
What other show on the history of the planet

559
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,460
Has been asked to speak at the U.N.?

560
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,390
Oh, perfect. An organization that condemns terrorism

561
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,020
while secretly funding it

562
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,620
hosts a panel for a show that glorifies terrorists.

563
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,320
- Dude, I can't even look at you right now.  - Fine. Don't look.

564
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:59,160
What do you think?

565
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,520
Trust me. You don't want to know.

566
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:05,720
I do. I do want to know.

567
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,690
Oh, thank God.

568
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,690
* Moving in an elliptical pattern *

569
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,920
Man, I'm  really glad you decided to come to the party.

570
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,090
Oh, thanks, man. That's...

571
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,090
Vanessa cares about you a lot, 

572
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,020
And I know that she was hoping you'd come.

573
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,990
- You know...  -Yeah, yeah, I know.

574
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,260
There he is.

575
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,690
Oh, speak of the devil. Hey. To, uh, to fresh starts.

576
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,590
I'm happy you're here, Humphrey.

577
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,060
Me, too.

578
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,660
So, Scott, you are in big trouble.

579
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,890
I cannot believe you told Vanessa to take professor Rifkin

580
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,820
- For art in the world.  - Why? I mean, I liked him.

581
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,560
Dude, he's totally old school, not to mention just plain old.

582
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,560
I mean, 

583
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,790
his lecture notes are literally turning yellow with age.

584
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,420
Please do tell. What other professors are you recommending?

585
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,590
Yeah, let's hear it, because katie's gonna have

586
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,990
- To weigh in from now on.  - I... I'm  at a party.

587
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,590
- I really don't feel like taking a test right now.  - Excuse me, everyone.

588
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,120
Can you please stop with that noise?

589
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,620
- Hi, everyone.  - What the hell?

590
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,620
Well, most of you don't know me.

591
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,590
My name is Blair Waldorf. But a lot of you know

592
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,290
My roommate, who threw this amazing party... Georgina.

593
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,520
Georgina!

594
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,060
Yeah, I know. Georgina rocks, right?

595
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,020
I mean, it's funny, 'cause I never knew

596
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:26,090
That a Jesus freak could throw such a good party, 

597
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,190
But I guess I was wrong. So, everyone, raise a glass

598
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,990
Or a... Plastic cup of foam

599
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,690
To the coolest christian I know... Georgina Sparks.

600
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,790
What do you know, what do you know

601
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,060
What do you know about Jesus?

602
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,390
What do you know, what do you know

603
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,520
What do you know about the lord?

604
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:48,660
What do you know, what do you know about Jesus

605
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,720
And his love?

606
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,220
Oh... My God.

607
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,990
This is a conversion party.

608
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,020
I can't believe it. Georgina threw this party

609
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,160
And invited all her friends here

610
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,190
To convert the vulnerable freshmen.

611
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,920
It seems that Blair Waldorf has finally found Jesus

612
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:10,560
And invited him to crash Georgina's party.

613
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,790
- Carter, wait.  - So that's the whole reason

614
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,860
You wanted me to go out with you tonight...

615
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,620
You knew i'd help you screw over Chuck.

616
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,560
Chuck had screwed me over or... or at least I thought he had.

617
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,460
- I wanted to get him back.  - Serena, listen to you. What's your deal?

618
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,420
You're acting out 'cause daddy doesn't love you?

619
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,320
- Is that why you skipped out on Brown, too?  - Please.

620
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:38,460
No. I told you how I felt, and you blew me off

621
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,290
Until you needed someone to do your dirty work.

622
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,960
It's time to find a new bad habit, 

623
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,620
'Cause it's not gonna be me anymore.

624
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,820
V.I.P. V.I.P. Room at the Monkey Bar.

625
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,290
- Monkey Bar.  - Can't wait.  - The limo's waiting downstairs.

626
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,760
We were worried about you. We missed you so much.

627
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,220
I can't tell you how my heart filled with joy

628
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,830
When we got your call inviting us to share his glory

629
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,490
- With all of your new friends.  - I didn't invite you here.

630
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,490
- We thought our little lamb had been lost for good.  - I am lost for good.

631
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,630
This isn't East Ridge High School prom.

632
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,060
- Bye.  - Hello. Hey, uh, excuse me.

633
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,630
Could I get everyone's attention, please?

634
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,560
Hey. Hi. Hello. I'm Dan. I just want to let everybody know here.

635
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,290
That, uh, Blair Waldorf over there

636
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,990
invited some people from Georgina's past,

637
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,030
just so she could embarrass her.

638
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,630
But you know, we're...we're all starting college here, and college is

639
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,730
supposed to be a place where you're not judged

640
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,320
by what you believe or...or the friends you make.

641
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,030
You're here to make new friends and start over, right?

642
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,860
So last time I checked, I mean, I think...

643
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,790
- I think this...this party's pretty fun. Yeah?  - Yeah.

644
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,790
Yeah, okay. So... Who wants to leave with Blair?

645
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,190
All right, and who wants to stay here

646
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,490
and drink cheap beer with me?

647
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,390
It's a no-brainer.

648
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,360
* She was so shy

649
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,930
till I drove...*

650
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,260
Thank you. You didn't have to do that.

651
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,160
Yeah, I did.

652
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,030
* I make them good girls go bad *

653
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,030
Let's get a beer.

654
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,090
* I make them good girls go bad *

655
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,060
Uh...oh, B. Looks like your new flock was just led astray,

656
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,930
and by Dan Humphrey no less.

657
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,930
I guess they know a force profit

658
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,320
when they see it.

659
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,730
Hi.

660
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:38,460
- You mind if I join you?  - It's your home.

661
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,660
Dan told you I was here?

662
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,960
I was...

663
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,090
glad you felt like you could come here,

664
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,230
that you felt like this was a safe place.

665
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,660
I'm really sorry, Rufus.

666
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,230
I never meant for it to get this messed up.

667
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,930
None of it was your fault.

668
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,030
Well, I didn't help matters.

669
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,930
I shouldn't have blown up at you the way that I did.

670
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,360
So... Talk to me.

671
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,130
Well, um...

672
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,830
I called Brown

673
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,660
and deferred for a year.

674
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,490
Okay.

675
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,390
It may have been for the wrong reasons at the time,

676
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,790
I...I think.

677
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,830
Well, no, I...I know that it was the right decision.

678
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:39,660
I would have just been going because my mom wanted me to go,

679
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:42,430
and while that's a good reason, that's not good enough.

680
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,560
You know, I did the same thing.

681
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,560
Well,it was Rutgers, not Brown,

682
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,540
but I got in and I realized that if I didn't pursue music,

683
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,860
I'd never do it.

684
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:54,190
I wish I had that same sense of purpose.

685
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,190
But I hope that if I...if I take this time, that I'll find it.

686
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,430
Gosh.

687
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,590
How am I gonna tell my mom?

688
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,090
Maybe I could help you figure that out.

689
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,060
I know I'm not the first guy

690
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,830
that your mom's brought into your life,

691
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:16,730
But if you and Eric will let me,

692
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,930
I'd really like to be more to you than...

693
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:23,330
than just Lily's most recent husband.

694
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,260
Let me help you with this.

695
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,690
Wow. I, uh...

696
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,930
I would really appreciate that, Rufus.

697
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,890
I'm sorry, mom.

698
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,390
It wasn't my intention to embarrass you or daddy.

699
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,590
Look, I wouldn't be doing any of this,

700
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,060
if I didn't feel the way that I do.

701
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,930
I really, really like him, and...

702
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:47,990
Mom, please. Don't be like that.

703
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,290
Mom?

704
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,760
I guess we didn't fool the doorman.

705
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:01,660
So you told your mom the truth?

706
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,130
I didn't want to risk everything with my family

707
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:07,190
for some fling that wasn't gonna last.

708
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,460
But?

709
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,930
Well, if your family can accept us together,

710
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,330
maybe one day mine will, too.

711
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:17,090
And if not?

712
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,660
It's a risk that I'm willing to take.

713
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,960
There's a reason we never went downtown...

714
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,690
It's awful.

715
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,690
The minute you cross 14th street,

716
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,830
people forget there's a class system.

717
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,660
B, you will find your place. Just give it time.

718
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,660
No, I found my place, and it's at the bottom.

719
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,390
It's a point of pride now that I see who's on top.

720
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,730
Anyway, it's all turned out for the best.

721
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,760
If I hadn't been so distracted,

722
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,190
I would've been able to force you to go to Brown.

723
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,230
That's sweet, but no, you wouldn't have.

724
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,490
I am sorry I pulled a disappearing act on you.

725
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,230
I'm sure you'll find a way to make it up to me...

726
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:02,390
In the handbag department at Bendel's.

727
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,830
Now normally I'd be more worried about Brown,

728
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,630
but you actually seem a lot better than you have in a while.

729
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,290
I really am.

730
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,690
It was so much easier

731
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,630
when it was just about where we sat on the met steps.

732
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,260
Yeah, but we've...

733
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,390
We've been here, done this.

734
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,060
But I was so good at it.

735
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,030
Well...

736
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:30,690
Then it's time for a new challenge...

737
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,290
For both of us.

738
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,630
I'm glad you're not going to Brown.

739
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,860
I need you here.

740
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:37,830
Same.

741
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:40,790
Mm.

742
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,360
Bye.

743
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,460
Bye, you.

744
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,600
I'm sorry I'm late,

745
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,770
but I have a good excuse.

746
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,600
What is this?

747
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,770
A review of all the professors I had this summer.

748
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:15,070
And look, I even gave them grades.

749
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,870
Wow. This is amazing.

750
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,130
I'm sorry...

751
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,400
For that weird moment with Katie last night.

752
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:25,970
I think I got a little, um, overwhelmed

753
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,330
from meeting all your friends.

754
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,430
That's okay.

755
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,770
That was kind of the least weird part of the whole night.

756
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,800
Yeah, when Dan... He got on the mike

757
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,300
and he convinced everyone to stay at the party,

758
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,570
that was insane. Is he usually like that?

759
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,670
No. Dan is more of a corner-of-the-party guy.

760
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:51,330
Should I call him, see if he'll join us?

761
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,500
Call him later. I just want to be with you right now.

762
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,800
What do you want, Serena?

763
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:14,800
There's a reason I always come back to you, Carter.

764
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,630
- And it's not because you're my bad habit.  - What then?

765
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,830
You're the only one who understood

766
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,000
why I needed to find my father.

767
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:26,130
You were there for me during all of that, and I trust you.

768
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,070
Anyone would have done the same thing.

769
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,800
No, they wouldn't have.

770
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,800
And I don't want anyone else.

771
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,230
I want you.

772
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,170
Mm.

773
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,100
You were right about the dorms.

774
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,900
The lighting is awful.

775
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,070
Are you okay?

776
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,600
Mm.

777
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,200
I am now.

778
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:45,300
* We are all embers through all of the devilish things we do *

779
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:48,830
* From the same fire through all of the devilish things we do *

780
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,670
* We are all embers through all of the devilish things we do *

781
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,730
* From the same fire

782
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:02,930
through all of the devilish things we do *

783
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,430
Hello?

784
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,430
Hey. Do you want to meet me and Scott

785
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
so we can download about the epicness last night?

786
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:11,500
Mm. No, you know, I'm still a little wrecked.

787
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,830
So, uh, I'll... I'll call you later.

788
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,570
Okay. Bye.

789
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,530
* We are all embers

790
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,200
from the same fire.

791
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:27,070
We are all embers *

792
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,430
Apparently, higher education

793
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,500
doesn't make for smarter decisions.

794
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:35,970
So take out your notebooks and sharpen your pencils, kids.

795
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,070
Gossip girl's going to college,

796
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,830
and this class has a lot to learn.
