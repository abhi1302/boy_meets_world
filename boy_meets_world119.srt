Scuba duba.

00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:13,001
Mr. Matthews,

I have obviously failed you...

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,634
on so many levels.

30
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:18,770
An acronym is
a pronounceable formation...

31

made by a combination
of letters.

32
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,145
I told you.

33
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:28,484
So, now, can anyone tell me
what SCUBA stands for?

34
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:31,582
Come on.
Someone take a stab at it.

35
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,061
Mr. Hunter, you haven't spoken
since the fourth grade.

36
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:40,795
S-c-u-b-a.
What does it stand for?

37
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,769

Very well.
Take it away, Mr. Minkus.

41
00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:59,943
No.

42
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,477
I beg your pardon?

00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,489

Hey. Get up.

put a box on your face.

out of this one...

of those Kodak moments.

explain to Cory...

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,216
the meaning
of those silver gloves?

110
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,687
Not yet.

111
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,691
Well, then how's he supposed
to know they're important?

112
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,193
I put them on his face.

113
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,129

that you even won those gloves.

Uh-huh. I'm Mommy
and Daddy's big girl.

122
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,916
That's right, and now
that you're a big girl...

123
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,482
it's not hard
for you to understand...

124
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,050
that you don't
have to get a present...

125
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,619
every time
it's somebody else's birthday.

126
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,825
But you always used
to give me presents...

127
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,697
on Cory and Eric's birthdays.

128
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,259
That's because we didn't
want you to feel bad, sweetie.

129

No, never. Did you?

Sure, in my bathtub.

139

You can totally see things
growing down there.

this underwater life...

154
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,180
Well, because otherwise...

155
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,719
I look like you.

156
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:45,623
It's not very evolved
to ridicule the human form.

157
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,023
Each of our bodies...

158
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,392
is the master creation
of Mother Nature.

159
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,057
Well, except for Minkus.

160
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,157
He was created by Mother Goose.

162
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:01,031
Yep, and here he comes.

a stick of Juicy Fruit.

I don't know, but

he's doing it better than us.

179
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:59,060
Hey, what's with the necklace?

180
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,930
oh, my dad gave it to me.

181
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,298
It's one of
those really important...

182
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,202
father-son gifts that
you don't understand what it is.

183
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,297
Been there.
My dad once gave me...

184
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,205
a gold-plated
tire pressure gauge...

185
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,233
he won at the company
bowling tournament.

186
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,075
Try getting psyched over that.

187
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,775
I wonder what happens
when I pull this.

188
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,407
[Hissing]

189
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,509
Now I know.

190
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,952
Have you taken leave of
your senses?

191
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,549
You can endanger the safety
of yourself and others.

192
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:28,561
No touching the equipment
until the dive master gets here.

193
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,620
Yeah, who is

this dive master anyway?

194
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,324
I don't care who it is,

as long as it gets us...

195
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,391
out of school, underwater,

and away from Feeny.

196
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,699
Good afternoon, fellow divers.

197
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:41,298
BOTH: Aah!

198
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,138
Yes, Mr. Matthews, Mr. Hunter...

199
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:46,270
I'm a certified dive master
and have been for years.

200
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,748
oK, I'm thinking
Upholstery Club.

201
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:55,846
Now, the first rule of diving
is never dive alone.

202
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,153
Therefore,

I would like each of you...

203
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:01,354
to select a partner
to be your diving buddy.

204
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,294
-Buddy?
-Buddy.

205
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,298
-Buddy?
-oK.

206
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,629
oh, how cute.

207
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,000
It's the Little Mermaid
and Aqua Nerd.

208
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,666
Now, one of our first drills

will be buddy breathing...

209
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,005
where you
share your regulator...

210
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,672
and breathe through
the same mouthpiece.

211
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,341
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.

212
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,251
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.

213
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:31,022
Did you brush
your teeth this morning?

214
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,617
I'm not sure. What day is it?

215
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,991
No, of course

I know your name is Donna.

216
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,196
Vicky's just a little pet name
I like to use.

217
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:48,139
You know,

like honey, darling, Vicky.

218
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,869
You're going to hang up
on me now, aren't you?

219
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,241
Yes, you are. oK.

220
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,212
Hey, how come
you're not wearing...

221
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,181
the little silver mittens
Dad gave you?

222
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,683
What?

223
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,378
I must have left them
at the pool.

224
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,751
No big deal. I'll buy him
another pair tomorrow.

225
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,848
Eric, scuba is so cool.

226
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,792
Look. I stayed under the water
for 20 minutes.

227
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,261
Your fingers
look like Grandma's neck.

228
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,524
Hey, guys.

229
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,861
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey, Dad.

230
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,867
Cory,
it occurred to me today...

231
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,232
that I never
really explained to you...

232
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,134
about that gift
I gave you this morning.

233
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,365
It's oK, Dad.

234
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,566
A gift like that
doesn't really need explaining.

235
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,007
No, well,

I explained to Eric...

236
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,976
about Grandpa's buck knife
after I gave it to him.

237
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:29,141
Have I told you lately
how much I love that knife, Dad?

238
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:35,211
You know, in the Navy,
I was on the boxing team.

239
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,689
-Really?
-Yeah, I wasn't half bad either.

240
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,557
You used to get in the ring
and duke it out with other guys?

241
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,391
What does this have to do
with the silver mittens?

242
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,126
They're not silver mittens.
They're silver gloves.

243
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,657
I won them
for coming in second place.

244
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,169
Is second place that good?

245
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,434
There's only two guys
in the ring.

246
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,941
Not second place
in one boxing match.

247
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,738
Second in
my weight division...

248
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,109
in the entire
United States Navy.

249
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,675
What?

250
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,183
Yeah.
That's why I'm so proud...

251
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:08,187
of those
little silver gloves.

252
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,711
So, who'd you lose to, Dad?

253
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:14,193
The baddest, meanest,

ugliest guy in the Navy.

254
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,660
I fought him
in the championship fight.

255
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:18,357
Did you hear that, Cor?
The championship.

256
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,866
-I heard.
-This was a brutal fight.

257
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,027
-Was there blood?
-oh, buckets.

258
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,434
Buckets!

259
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,200
See, the funny thing is,
I thought it was his blood.

260
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,502
I thought I had the fight won...

261
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,475
till the referee
held up the other guy's arm.

262
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,445
See, my eye was kind of
hanging out of its socket.

263
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,810
Which I should have realized
because I was looking...

264
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,407
at his head and his shoes
at the same time.

265
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,918
Boy, Dad, you really must have
fought your heart out...

266
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,852
to win
those little silver gloves.

267
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:45,221
Yeah, so I lost

a little depth perception.

268
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,589
But to tell you the truth,
Cor...

269
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,719
as good as it was
to win those silver gloves...

270
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,695
what was great was hoping...

271
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,632
that someday I'd have a son
to pass them on to.

272
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,328
And did you?

273
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,361
Yes, I did, huh?

274
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,838
I thought
you guys'd just like...

275
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,398
to hear about it,

so I'll see you at dinner.

276
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04,933
See you, Dad.

277
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,055
No, they're not mittens
on a chain, oK?

278
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,025
They happen to be
the silver boxing gloves...

279
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:23,324
of the second best boxer in
the whole United States Navy.

280
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,595
Yeah. Yeah--oK, thanks.

281
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,396
They're not at
the comic book store either?

282
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,063
No. They're nowhere
in the whole world.

283
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,697
But I'm gonna find them.

284
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,038
I'm gonna retrace every step
I took today.

285
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,838
You know, Cor, if you
just kept them wrapped up...

286
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,208
Iike my buck knife...

287
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,872
none of this
ever would have happened.

288
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,505
You told me to wear them!

289
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,949
Sometimes you got to know
when to ignore me.

290
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,613
Huh? Look.

291
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,622
I thought that knife
didn't mean that much to you.

292
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,783
It doesn't. I just make it
look like it does.

293
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,420
I keep it wrapped up,
and I polish it.

294
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,089
I mean,

I might not be into it...

295
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:02,397
but maybe my kid will get
a kick out of it someday, huh?

296
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,630
-Eric...
-Yeah?

297
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,571
I've got to find those gloves,
and I need you to cover for me.

298
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,098
Just tell Mom and Dad
I went to Shawn's for dinner.

299
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,509
-oK, you're covered.
-All right, thanks.

300
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:15,537
Hey, be careful.
Not that I care.

301
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,122
Cory, dinner.

302
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,218
Eric, where is your brother?

303
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,752
I don't know.
oh, no, wait, I do know.

304
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,264
He said he was
going to Shawn's for dinner...

305
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,458
and I told him
to go right ahead.

306
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,659
oh, and you felt that...

307
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,827
that was in the realm
of your authority?

308
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,736
I did. After all,

I am the oldest boy...

309
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,401
and, after tonight,
quite possibly the only boy...

310
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,707
but I kid the family.

311
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,679
Come in.

312
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:56,347
Yeah, hi, Eric.

Good to see you, too.

313
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,583
Hello, Shawn.

314
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,318
How you guys doing?
Is Cory here?

315
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,825
No, of course he's not, Shawn.

316
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,387
As you well know, Cory's
at your house having dinner.

317
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,024
Right, right.

318
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,925
Cory is at my house
and I did know that.

319
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,495
Eric Would be correct there.

320
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,099
Well, then why are you here?

321
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,441
Why am l, as in me, here?

322
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,613
I think that's one
Eric could handle. Eric?

323
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,378
It's plain as day.

324
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,181
Sure. oh, well, of course.

325
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,212
See, obviously
Cory sent Shawn over here...

326
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,746
to see what we were having
for dinner...

327
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,419
to decide if
he made the wise choice...

328
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,224
in going to Shawn's house
for dinner.

329
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,890
And why didn't he just call?

330
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:42,025
Ha ha!
Shawn, you're hurting me.

331
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:45,060
Pathetic.

332
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:48,335
No--no, it's not pathetic.

333
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,137
It's not pathetic for me...

334
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,643
because
I'm not in this family...

335
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,702
so I can leave.

336
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,875
Eric, what's going on?

337
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,076
Where's Cory?

338
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,483
I honestly
don't know where Cory is.

339
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,784
Alan, it's after dark.

I'm kind of worried.

340
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,848
So am l. How is he going to
survive in the adult world...

341
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:08,383
if he can't come up with
a better cover story?

342
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,390
[Splash]

343
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,061
MR. FEENY: Mr. Matthews!

344
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:52,696
Mr. Matthews! Mr. Matthews!

345
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,503
CORY: Uh-oh!

346
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,874
Mr. Matthews, didn't you hear
a word I said today?

347
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,074
Diving alone is not only stupid,
it's dangerous.

348
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,604
There isn't
even a lifeguard on duty.

349
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,809
This has got to be...

350
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,080
the most half-baked idea
you've ever had.

351
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,917
CORY: No. no.
It was fuLLy-baked.

352
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,527
Look. Mr. Feeny.
you have to Listen to me.

353
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,529
I Lost my father's
siLver gLoves...

354
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:18,996
and I have to find them.

355
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:22,364
You're dripping on my oxfords.

356
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,529
Now put your clothes on
and go home.

357
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:37,707
Cory!
Thank God you're alive!

358
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,742
[Sighs]
Now I'm going to kill you.

359
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,347
I'm sorry, Mom.

360
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,791
Dad, I'm sorry.

361
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,022
I lost your silver gloves.

362
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,394
I didn't know how important
they were to you.

363
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,558
Mr. Feeny just called
and said you snuck...

364
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,034
into the "Y" and
you were diving by yourself.

365
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,229
Is that true?

366
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,295
I tried to find the gloves.

367
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,967
Cory, I don't care about
those gloves.

368
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,944
Dad, yes, you do.
You know you do.

369
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,538
Yes, I care about them.

That's why I gave them to you.

370
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,242
And when I was young
and in the Navy...

371
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,772
they were the most important
thing in the world to me.

372
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,786
But now I don't care
if I lose those silly gloves.

373
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,789
I care if I lose you.
Huh? You understand that?

374
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,792
Maybe it's best
if I never leave home.

375
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,852
Bad things only happen
when I leave.

376
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,488
Alan, he's grounding himself.

377
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,897
Don't let him
take that away from us.

378
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,629
Sorry, Mom.
Go ahead and ground away.

379
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,606
Why don't you just go upstairs,
dry off, and go to bed?

380
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,801
[Doorbell rings]

381
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:39,805
Amy.

382
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,574
-George.
-Alan.

383
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:44,014
Thanks for
being there tonight, George.

384
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,713
Mr. Feeny, you didn't come over
to yell at me more, did you?

385
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:52,213
No, I can wait until

we're back in class for that.

386
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:55,955
I just thought
that maybe you'd want these.

387
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,297
Mr. Feeny,
I can't believe this!

388
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,026
This is great! Thank you!

389
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,734
How did I get here?

390
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,469
We'll pretend it never happened.

391
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,543
Well, good night all.

392
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,047
Wait a minute.

393
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,277
How come it was oK
for you to go diving...

394
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,512
without a buddy,
but not for me?

395
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,521
I didn't have to go diving,
Einstein.

396
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,045
They were in the filter.

397
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,423
You see what you give me
to work with?

398
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,995
Dad, here.

399
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,236
What are you doing?
I gave these to you.

400
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:43,730
No. I don't deserve them,

at least not yet.

401
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,370
Just hold onto them
for me now...

402
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,777
and give them
back to me...

403
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,644
on the most important day
of my life.

404
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,513
When will that be?

405
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,314
Whatever day you give them back.

406
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:04,863
You want me to lie to Mommy?

407
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:07,058
of course not. I don't want you
to lie to Mommy.

408
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,863
I just want this to be
a secret between you and me.

409
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,699
oK. What is it?

410
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:15,901
Yes!

411
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,102
Go on. open it.

412
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,746
Thank you, Daddy.

413
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,271
oh, you're welcome.

414
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,146
What's the matter?

415
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:30,155
Did you win this horse
when you were in the Navy?

416
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,383
No.

417
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,683
Then why is this important?

418
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,855
Well, it's important
because you wanted it...

419
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:39,159
and I went to the store...

420
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:40,688
and I bought it for you
with my money.

421
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:44,692
Did you win this horse
when you were in the Navy?

422
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,864
Yes, I didമഊ㤊㤹ഹ《㨰〰〺㔬〰ⴠ㸭〠㨰〰㈺〬ര㰊潦瑮挠汯牯∽昣晦て∰猠穩㵥㐱眾睷琮獶扵楴汴獥渮瑥⼼潦瑮ാ
