00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,665
Gossip Girl Here-

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,600
Your One And Only Source Into
The Scandalous Lives Of Manhattan'S Elite.

3
00:00:05,635 --> 00:00:07,800
How'S Your Mom Doing
With The Divorce And Everything?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,400
So My Dad Left Her
For Another Man.

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,600
She Lost 15 Pounds,
Got An Eye Lift.

6
00:00:11,635 --> 00:00:12,265
It'S Been Good For Her.

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,550
My Mom Kind Of Left Us
A Couple Months Ago.

8
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:16,765
My Dad And My Sister
Don'T Really See That.

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,065
I Don'T Know What'S Happened
With My Wife Or My Marriage,

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,400
And You Showing Up Here Randomly
Doesn'T Make Figuring That Out Any Easier.

11
00:00:22,435 --> 00:00:24,200
Am I The Only One
Who Thinks This Is Extremely Weird?

12
00:00:24,235 --> 00:00:24,965
Forget About It.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,065
If Dad Can Let It Go, So Can You.

14
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,900
I Can'T Believe You Didn'T Tell Me
Your Mom Came Home.

15
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:29,265
Your Wife Despises Me.

16
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,100
- I Wouldn'T Say That.
- Well, She Did.

17
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:32,300
You Should Deal With Your Father.

18
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:32,900
He Needs You.

19
00:00:32,935 --> 00:00:33,665
I Don'T.

20
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,965
We Broke Up, Okay?

21
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,400
He Was Gonna Get Back Together With Me,

22
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:37,765
But Only So My Mom Would Help His Dad.

23
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,665
I Need Your Support Here, Son,
And Your Trust.

24
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, You Better Hope For Your Sake
They Don'T Call Your Son To The Stand.

25
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,600
Do You Like Me?

26
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,100
Define "Like. "

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
Gossip. Girl. Season 01 Episode 09

28
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,200
As Per Gossip Girl'S
Thanksgiving Tradition,

29
00:01:05,235 --> 00:01:07,500
I'M Trading My Laptop For Stove Top,

30
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,700
And For The Next 16 Hours,
The Only Thing I'M Dishing Is Seconds.

31
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,100
When The Cat'S Away,
The Mice Will Play.

32
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,200
Have Fun, Little Rodents.

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,200
I Mean, Who Gets Wasted
On Thanksgiving?

34
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,100
The Holidays Are Lonely For People.

35
00:01:22,135 --> 00:01:23,300
I Wanted To Keep 'Em Company.

36
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,965
Whoo!

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,450
Thanksgiving.

38
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:27,900
Last Year.

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,800
Your Mom Is Freaking Out,
So My Mom Is Freaking Out.

40
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:32,367
What, Which Means You Freak Out?

41
00:01:32,402 --> 00:01:33,900
Blair, Just Cut The Cord.
Go Nuts.

42
00:01:33,935 --> 00:01:35,200
Come On.
Let'S Do Shots.

43
00:01:35,235 --> 00:01:35,765
Come On!

44
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,000
I Told Lily That You Were Buying A Pie.

45
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:39,965
Oh, Pie.

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,100
Where Is Your Purse?

47
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,200
- Uh, My Purse...
- Oh, Great. All Right.

48
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,050
You Stay Here, Okay?

49
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:48,365
I'M Gonna Go Look.

50
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,100
Don'T Drink Or Hit On Anything.

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,265
Pie'S Been Secured.

52
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,100
Thanksgiving No Longer
Needs To Be Canceled, All Right?

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,800
Um...

54
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,700
Hey, Mom, You Know, I Need To Go.

55
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:01,700
I'M Sorry.
Bye.

56
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,200
Oh, Man.

57
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Hey!
What Are You Doing?

58
00:02:10,435 --> 00:02:12,400
Hey, Right Of Way, Pal.

59
00:02:12,435 --> 00:02:13,165
Screw You, Buddy!

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,965
Hey, Uh, Excu-Excuse Me.

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,900
D- Do You Need, Like,
A Crossing Guard Or A Cab Maybe?

62
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,565
Oh, Pie.

63
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,700
It'S More Like Roadkill Now,
But, Uh, Better It Than You, Right?

64
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,300
Um...

65
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
I'M-I'M Dan...

66
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:31,200
Humphrey.

67
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

68
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,900
Uh, I Don'T Know.

69
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:35,200
We Met Last Year.

70
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,800
You M- You Might Not Remember.

71
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,300
Yeah, I-You Probably Don'T,
But Look, You Should Be More Careful.

72
00:02:40,335 --> 00:02:42,000
You Need To Keep Your Hands Off Of Her.

73
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:42,565
Blair!

74
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,300
Trying To Take Advantage Of Her
On The Holidays.

75
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:45,700
Come On.
Let'S Go, Serena.

76
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,600
Bye, Dave.

77
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,000
Bye.

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Bye.

79
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,500
Bye, Serena.

80
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,900
Hey.

81
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,165
And Hello To You.

82
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,900
Big National Holiday.
You Excited?

83
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,200
Kind Of Am.

84
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Might Be The First Thanksgiving
In A While That I Actually Remember.

85
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,800
Yeah, I Bet.

86
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,100
Huh?

87
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,965
Nothing.

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,165
- Uh, You- Uh, You At Blair'S?
- Almost.

89
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,500
Her Dad'S Gonna Be Home
For The First Time Since He Left,

90
00:03:16,535 --> 00:03:17,965
So She'S Really Excited.

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,250
Oh, Well, Family Reunions
Are All Around Then.

92
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:22,500
Uh, We, Too,
Have A Full Humphrey Household.

93
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,865
Hopefully, It'Ll Stick.

94
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,600
Well, It Seems Like
Your Mom Is Really Trying.

95
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,300
Better Thanksgiving Than Never.

96
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,400
Call Me Between Every Course?

97
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,550
Okay.

98
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,400
Mwah. Bye.

99
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,300
Mom, Is It Really Okay
To Cook With This Much Heavy Cream?

100
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,765
Our Arteries Give Us
A Free Pass On Turkey Day.

101
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,300
It'S A Shame Our Family Doesn'T
Have A Few Hundred More Members.

102
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:42,400
Do You Think I Bought Too Much?

103
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:43,565
Only By Several Tons.

104
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,765
But It'S Our First Holiday Back.

105
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,400
I Wanted To Make Sure It Was Special.

106
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,300
I Think They Call That Guilt.

107
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,600
Yeah, I Guess They Do.

108
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,100
But If It Means More Midnight Turkey
Sandwiches For All Of Us, Then So Be It.

109
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:55,865
Yeah, See, Dan?

110
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,300
Uh, We On This Side Of The Kitchen
Choose To Be Positive.

111
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah, Dan.

112
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,165
What'S It Gonna Be?

113
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,100
You With Us Or Against Us?

114
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:02,800
Uh...

115
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,565
Fine.

116
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,300
But Only If I Can Take
The Cranberry Sauce Out Of The Can.

117
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:08,000
That Is My Specialty.

118
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,600
I Have To Find This Recipe
Before My Dad Gets Here.

119
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,800
Harold Waldorf'S Famous Pumpkin Pie.

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,265
Well, It May Have Been Bobby Flay'S,

121
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,400
But It Didn'T Stop My Dad
From Taking Credit For It.

122
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,400
It'S Gonna Be Perfect!

123
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:20,400
Look At You.

124
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,300
Quite The Chipper Sous-Chef.

125
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:23,600
Well, I'M In A Good Mood.

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,800
It Happens.

127
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,500
Sometimes 'Cause I Increase My Lexapro,

128
00:04:26,535 --> 00:04:27,965
Sometimes Because My Dad'S In Town.

129
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,800
And Sometimes, Mostly Because
Things Are Good With A Boy.

130
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,265
You And Nate Get Back Together?

131
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,200
You Mean Since Gossip Girl
Published Pictures Of Him And Some Skank?

132
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,100
So That'S A No.

133
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
What'S Chuck Doing Today?

134
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,700
Why Are You Asking Me?

135
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,100
Well, You Guys Are Friends.

136
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,900
And, Blair, Look,
You Know You Can Tell Me Anything.

137
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,700
I'D Be The Last Person To Judge Anyone.

138
00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:51,700
With Good Reason.

139
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,800
Blair, I Saw You With Chuck.

140
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,700
I Don'T Know What I Was Thinking.

141
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,800
I Mean, Sleeping With Him Once,
Maybe You Could Understand, But Twice?

142
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:04,800
Wait.
You Slept With Him?

143
00:05:04,835 --> 00:05:05,600
- Shh!
- Ugh.

144
00:05:05,635 --> 00:05:06,365
Blair!

145
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,465
What Happened To No Judging?

146
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,150
I'M Not, But I Thought
You Wanted To Wait.

147
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:10,765
I Thought You Wanted
To Make Things Special.

148
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,100
Oh, So Nate Gets The Free Pass,
And I'M The Slut?

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,600
Tell Me You Didn'T
Sleep With Chuck For Revenge.

150
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,600
Well, It Wasn'T
Because I Like His Natural Musk,

151
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,300
And Besides, Nothing Hurts More Than
Sleeping With The Best Friend, Right, S.

152
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,300
Way To Prove A Point.

153
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,665
Well, I Learned From The Master.

154
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,700
If You'Re Sleeping With Chuck,
I'D Say The Student'S Become The Master.

155
00:05:30,735 --> 00:05:33,500
Are You Jealous
You Didn'T Get To Sleep With Him First?

156
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,900
There Had To Be Somebody
Left On The Upper East Side.

157
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,500
Blair, Darling,
Are You Going To Help Me At All?

158
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,700
Serena, Do You Know
When Your Mother'S Arriving?

159
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,300
She'S Not.

160
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,700
We'Re Not Doing Thanksgiving
Here Anymore.

161
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,800
Oh.

162
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,665
Why?

163
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,000
Because I Uninvited Them.

164
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,400
Happy Holidays, Eleanor.

165
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,400
Mom, I Know It'Sy Fault That
We'Re Here, But Let'S Not Get Crazy.

166
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,065
Well, I Don'T Know
What You'Re Complaining About.

167
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,000
I'M Just Trying To
Provide My Family With A Home-Cooked Meal.

168
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,700
You Don'T Know How To Cook.

169
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:16,867
Well, Don'T Blame Me.

170
00:06:16,902 --> 00:06:17,965
Talk To Your Sister.

171
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,500
She'S The One That Got Us
Exiled From The Waldorfs.

172
00:06:20,535 --> 00:06:21,165
Oh, I'M Sorry.

173
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,300
And Even If You Did Cook,
We Don'T Have An Oven.

174
00:06:23,335 --> 00:06:25,200
Preaching To The Converted, Eric.

175
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,900
Look, We'Ll Just Pick Up
A Few Things And Try To Make Do.

176
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,900
Like Peking Duck On Thanksgiving.

177
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:31,000
Not A Bad Idea.

178
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,165
No, Mom.

179
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,765
All The Other Shops Are Closed.

180
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,900
There'S Nothing Wrong With
Having Chinese Food On Thanksgiving.

181
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:37,365
What?

182
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,600
Jews Having Been Doing It
On Christmas Since Forever.

183
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,300
Look, A Pumpkin.

184
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,600
Isn'T This...

185
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,500
This Is Festive, Yes?

186
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,000
We'Re Gonna Eat A Pumpkin?

187
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,800
Mom.

188
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,700
Oh.

189
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,400
So You Couldn'T
Make It Past The Salad, Huh?

190
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:55,300
I Opened The Cranberries.

191
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:56,600
My Work Is Done.

192
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,300
How'S Blair'S?

193
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,700
Uh, I Wouldn'T Know.

194
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,265
She Gave Me The Boot.

195
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,800
Wh-She Kicked You Out Of Her House?

196
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,000
What Happened Now?

197
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,800
Uh, Don'T Ask,

198
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,400
But The Good News Is,
My Mom Is Gonna Slice Us Up A Pumpkin.

199
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,800
Oh, And There'S Duck.

200
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:11,465
No, No, No.

201
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,500
You Can'T Eat Duck And Raw Pumpkin
On Thanksgiving.

202
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Uh, You Know What?

203
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,365
I'M The Guardian Of Vanessa'S Sister'S Van
For The Weekend,

204
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,200
And We Here At The Humphrey Manor
Have An Oddly Large Kitchen Table.

205
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,400
What Are You Suggesting?

206
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:26,665
These Smell Great.

207
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,100
Yes, So We Can Starve
In A Fragrant Hotel Room.

208
00:07:29,135 --> 00:07:30,000
We'Re Not Starving.

209
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,000
Look, I Got Us Into This Mess,
So I'M Gonna Get Us Out Of It.

210
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,700
Elaborate, Serena.

211
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,600
Thanksgiving At The Humphreys.

212
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:37,965
Dan Invited Me,

213
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,700
And Eric'S Friends With His Sister,
And His Dad'S Really Cool.

214
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,700
Awesome.
I'M Leaving The Pumpkin.

215
00:07:42,735 --> 00:07:43,500
What Do You Say, Mom?

216
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,500
Found It!

217
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,550
Sous-Chef, You'Re Needed.

218
00:07:59,585 --> 00:08:00,892
Ready And Awaiting Orders.

219
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:02,165
I See We Have Extra Help.

220
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes, Well, Serena'S Spending Thanksgiving
With Us This Year.

221
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:06,500
Ah, The More The Merrier.

222
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Happy To Have You, My Dear.

223
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:08,667
Whoo!

224
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:09,265
Yes!

225
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,400
The Canapés Were A Huge Success.

226
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:13,800
I Saved One For You, Blair.

227
00:08:13,835 --> 00:08:14,900
I'M Not Really Hungry.

228
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,665
Well, What Does That Mean,
You'Re Not Really Hungry?

229
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,200
Well, I Had, Like, 15 Of Them This Morning
When Daddy First Made Them.

230
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:22,600
15?

231
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:23,950
Serena.

232
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:24,600
Serena!

233
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,400
Do You Think That'S Wise?

234
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,865
Darling, She'S Fine.

235
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,400
She Has Been For Two Months.

236
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:30,900
What Did The Doctor Say?

237
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,000
Don'T Drive Us Crazy, Okay?

238
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,100
- So, Please.
- Ah, Fine.

239
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,300
We Are Going To Need To
Set Another Place At The Table.

240
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,700
Laurel Brought One Of The Models
I'M Working With.

241
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,300
Do I Know Her?
What'S Her Name?

242
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,200
His Name Is Roman.

243
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,600
Ah. Roman.

244
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,100
Not This One, Harold.

245
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,600
We Have To Work Together.

246
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,000
Hey, You!

247
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,650
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- You, Too.

248
00:08:56,685 --> 00:08:57,900
- Good To See You.
- Want One?

249
00:08:57,935 --> 00:08:58,765
Ah, Sure.

250
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,700
- Good Boy.
- Nate The Great.

251
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,400
- So What'D I Miss?
- Mm, Nothing.

252
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,400
You'Re About To Witness
The Return Of Sober Serena.

253
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:06,900
- Oh, Nate!
- Oh, No.

254
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:07,765
Or Maybe Not.

255
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,865
Sweetie, Would You Take Her Upstairs?

256
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,500
Put Her In The Bath Before Your Mother
Gets Wind Of This Whole Situation?

257
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:13,167
What, And Leave You All Alone?

258
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:14,800
Thanksgiving Is Our Thing.

259
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,000
Nate, Will You Please Take Care Of Her?

260
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:18,967
Please?

261
00:09:19,002 --> 00:09:19,751
Oh, I Will.

262
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:20,500
Come On.

263
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,500
Daddy, Can I Help With The Pumpkin Pie?

264
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:25,400
Of Course.

265
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,065
Thank You.

266
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,100
- Crush Them.
- Thank You Very Much.

267
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,200
Crush Them.

268
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
Caterers?

269
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,300
What'S Going On Here?

270
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,600
Everyone Is Getting Ready
For Our Lovely Dinner,

271
00:09:40,635 --> 00:09:41,800
And You Should Be, Too.

272
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,500
Everyone Except Daddy.

273
00:09:43,535 --> 00:09:44,500
Where Is He?

274
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
I Thought You Knew.

275
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,200
Knew What?

276
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,700
Your Father Isn'T Coming.

277
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,900
He Didn'T Tell You?

278
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,365
He Decided To Stay In Paris.

279
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,800
He'S Got Either Too Much Work,
Or Roman Is Too Much Work.

280
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:00,600
Who Knows?

281
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,765
I- I Don'T Understand.

282
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,300
If He Wasn'T Coming, Why Wouldn'T
He Just Call Me And Tell Me Himself?

283
00:10:04,335 --> 00:10:05,065
Darling, You Should Know By Now

284
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,400
That Your Father Is Not
A Fan Of The Difficult Conversation.

285
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,900
Now Why Don'T You Run Along
And Change Into Something A Little More...

286
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,300
Enchanting?

287
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,900
That'S Good.

288
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,765
Are You Sure You Don'T
Want Us To Stay With You?

289
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,100
Yeah, We Don'T Want To Leave You,
Mom, If You Don'T Feel Well.

290
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:27,565
Oh, No.

291
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,065
You Kids Have Fun.

292
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,300
I Don'T Have An Appetite Anyway.

293
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,700
Oh, Hold On A Second.

294
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:33,600
That Must Be Dan.

295
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,600
Hey!

296
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,700
- Room Service.
- Oh.

297
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,800
Oh, No, No, No, No, Sir.

298
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:40,217
You Have The Wrong Room.

299
00:10:40,252 --> 00:10:41,600
Oh, No, You'Re Early.

300
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,000
I Lied.

301
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:43,800
Mom.

302
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,600
All I Care About
Is That You Two Are Together.

303
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:50,300
I Don'T Want To Be An Imposition.

304
00:10:50,335 --> 00:10:51,100
No.

305
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,700
Man With Van, At Your Service.

306
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,300
- Hey.
- Hey.

307
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,800
Uh, Bold Choice Of Attire,
Mrs. Van Der Woodsen,

308
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,200
Unless It'S What They'Re Wearing
On The Runway These Days.

309
00:11:02,235 --> 00:11:04,400
No, My Mom Sicked Out
Because She Didn'T Want To Be Imposing.

310
00:11:04,435 --> 00:11:04,965
You Know What?

311
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,565
I Am Fine Just Curling Up
And Reading A Good Book.

312
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,300
But You'Re Supposed To Be
With Your Family On Thanksgiving.

313
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,100
Yeah, And Nicholas Sparks
Is Hardly Family.

314
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,700
I'M Not Taking No For An Answer.

315
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:17,800
In Fact, I'M Not Even Asking.

316
00:11:17,835 --> 00:11:19,000
You Are Coming With Us.

317
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,250
I'M Adult-Napping You.

318
00:11:21,285 --> 00:11:23,200
Fine, Just Stop Talking,

319
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
And I'Ll Get Ready.

320
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,900
Make It Snappy.
I'M Double-Parked.

321
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,000
Thanks.

322
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,265
Hey, Rufus Humphrey.

323
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,900
Leave A Message,
And I'Ll Get Back To You.

324
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,100
Rufus, It'S Lily.

325
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,200
Um, Your Very Persistent Son
Insisted That I Join You For Dinner.

326
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,200
I Want To Remind You That
My Kids Do Not Know That We Are Friendly,

327
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,900
And I Would Like To Keep It That Way.

328
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,900
That Said...

329
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,400
I Look Forward To Seeing You.

330
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,400
How Could He Just Blow Me Off?

331
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,300
Thanksgiving Is Our Ritual

332
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,765
You Know He Didn'T Even Call.

333
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,700
How Hard It Is To Pick Up The Phone?

334
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,400
Ms Blair, Maybe You Pick Up
Phone, Call Your Papa.

335
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,100
Maybe He Tell You The Real Story.

336
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,200
Real Story?

337
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,100
With Pearls...

338
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,000
This Is Good, Mum.

339
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,100
Thank God * Is Still Open.

340
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,500
I Have To Improvise Since We Been
Dis-Invited From The Waldorfs At The Last Minute.

341
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,000
Just Like I Was Asked To Step Down
From The Committee For The Snowflake Ball,

342
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:44,900
And How I Wasn'T Asked Back
To The Lincoln Center Foundation.

343
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,200
I Thought At Least, Your Father'S Lawyer
Might Join Us For Dessert.

344
00:12:47,235 --> 00:12:48,000
Mom, Stop.

345
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,000
You Were All For Acting Like
Nothing Was Wrong Until It Landed On You.

346
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:51,465
Nate.

347
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,600
I Forgot To Call The Bail Bondsman.

348
00:12:52,635 --> 00:12:53,765
Maybe He Has Nowhere To Go.

349
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,000
Mom, No One Is More Mad Than I Am,

350
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:56,165
But This Is Not The Right Way.

351
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,700
Nathaniel, I Don'T Need You
To Fight This Fight For Me.

352
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,400
Where Do You Think You'Re Going?

353
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:10,400
Anywhere But Here.

354
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,265
Thank You.

355
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,600
What'S Taking Dan And Serena So Long?

356
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:25,400
Hey, We'Re Here.

357
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,465
There You Are.

358
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,750
You'Re Lucky You Made It
While The Turkey'S Still Hot.

359
00:13:28,785 --> 00:13:31,000
Mom, This Is Serena,
And This Is Her Brother Eric.

360
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:32,565
It Is So Nice To Meet You Both.

361
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,900
- It'S Nice To Meet You, Too.
- Nice To Meet You.

362
00:13:33,935 --> 00:13:34,565
Hi.

363
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,700
And This Is Their Mother, Lily.

364
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,600
Happy Thanksgiving.

365
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,365
Just In Time,
Thanksgiving.Last Year.

366
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,200
But I Thought You Were Gonna Bring Pie.
Thanksgiving.Last Year.

367
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:54,065
I Did, But It Kinda
Got Run Over By A Taxi,

368
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,265
Uh, As I Was Trying To
Help This Girl Stay Out Of Traffic.

369
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,500
Ah, Well, Who Needs Dessert
When We Have A Real-Life Hero In Our Midst?

370
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:00,765
Your Brother Just Saved A Girl.

371
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,100
I Thought You Needed To Be
Near A Girl For That To Happen.

372
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,800
Not Just Any Girl.

373
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,465
The Girl.

374
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,900
Oh, The Blonde You Stalk At School?

375
00:14:06,935 --> 00:14:07,665
Just The One.

376
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,765
A Thing For Blondes.

377
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,000
You Are Your Father'S Son.

378
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,800
Not Just Any Blonde.

379
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,800
Apparently, I Like The Ones Who Get Drunk
On Thanksgiving And Almost Die.

380
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:18,400
Well, Your Dad Liked 'Em
Dangerous And Troubled, Too, So...

381
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,400
You Were Dangerous?

382
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,000
Who Said I Was Talking About Me?

383
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,500
Well, I Didn'T Realize
There Was Anyone Else.

384
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,800
Well, It Is So Nice To Meet You.

385
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,500
Alison.

386
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,400
Right, It'S Nice To Meet You, Too.

387
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,400
- Lily, Was It?
- Yes.

388
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,000
Well, I'M Just Gonna Take These Coats
And Put Them In, Um, Dan'S Room.

389
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,600
Uh, You Know What?
It'S Okay.

390
00:14:41,635 --> 00:14:42,700
I'Ve Got Them.

391
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,300
Oh.

392
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,600
Oh, Thank You.

393
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,765
Okay, Eric And Jenny, Napkin Duty.

394
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,700
Serena And Dan,
I Want Every Water Glass Filled,

395
00:14:52,735 --> 00:14:54,800
And Every Candle You Can Find Lit.

396
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,865
I Am Sorry.

397
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,100
- I Did Not Know That You Were-
- Back?

398
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,400
Well, I Am.

399
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,100
And Why Would You Know?

400
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,100
Well, Dan Never Mentioned It
When He Invited Me.

401
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,900
I Called.

402
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,500
I Didn'T Hear The Phone.

403
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,400
You Know What?

404
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,400
It'S Fine.

405
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,750
It'S Fine.
Let'S Just Have A Great Time.

406
00:15:15,785 --> 00:15:17,265
- This Holiday'S About Sharing.
- Right.

407
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,700
And If You Don'T Mind,
Um, Could We Not Share Too Much?

408
00:15:20,735 --> 00:15:23,100
I Haven'T Exactly
Told My Kids About My Past.

409
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,700
Well...

410
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,265
Our Past.

411
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,800
Hey, Turkey'S Almost Room Temp, Guys.

412
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,200
Come On Down.

413
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,800
You Grab The Mashed.

414
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,800
I Got That.

415
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,500
Happy Thanksgiving.

416
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:53,900
Blair...

417
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,800
You Haven'T Touched Your Food.

418
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,500
Come On, Darling.
What Has Gotten Into You?

419
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,400
Well, I Was Going To Wait
Till After Dinner,

420
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:04,700
But I Guess Now
Is As Good A Time As Any.

421
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,200
Did You Call Daddy And Say That
I Didn'T Want To See Him This Thanksgiving?

422
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,200
Of Course Not.

423
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,065
What A Ridiculous Accusation.

424
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,600
So You Didn'T Tell Him
That I Was So Angry At Him For Leaving,

425
00:16:15,635 --> 00:16:17,400
That I Didn'T Even
Want To Talk To Him Today?

426
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,500
You Had No Right To Uninvite Him.

427
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,000
When Are You Gonna
Get It Through Your Head?

428
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,750
- He Left Us.
- He Didn'T Leave Us.

429
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,700
- He Left You.
- That'S Enough.

430
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,800
That'S Enough.

431
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,800
If You Want To Take This Up With Me,

432
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,600
We Can Discuss It Later,
After Our Guests Have Left.

433
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:42,200
Right Now You Either Eat
Or You Leave The Table.

434
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,900
I Told You, I'M Not Hungry.

435
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,300
Or Maybe Dessert
Will Change Your Mind.

436
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,500
Where Is Daddy'S Pie?

437
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,365
I Don'T See His Pumpkin Pie.

438
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,300
Well, There Were So Many Delicious Choices
Coming From The Caterer,

439
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:57,200
We Just Sent That One
Down To The Doorman.

440
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,500
What Is Thanksgiving After All, Hmm?

441
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,500
Now Choose One Of
Those Amazing Desserts.

442
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,800
So, Uh, Mrs. Van Der Woodsen,

443
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,700
Um, What Were Thanksgivings Like
When You Were Growing Up?

444
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,817
Serena Said You Were Raised
In California?

445
00:18:24,852 --> 00:18:26,900
Oh, I Grew Up
On A Little Ranch In Montecito.

446
00:18:26,935 --> 00:18:28,300
I Didn'T Know There Were Little Ranches.

447
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:29,300
There Aren'T.

448
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,465
I Don'T Mean To Be Rude
,i Think I Should Get This.

449
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,100
Yeah, Sure.

450
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,500
Hey, We'Re Right In The Middle Of Di-

451
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,165
Yeah.

452
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,500
O- Of Course.
I'M On My Way.

453
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,700
What'S Up?

454
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,300
I'M Sorry, But I Have To Go.

455
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,400
Is Everything All Right?

456
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
No, But, Um,
It Will Be, I Hope.

457
00:18:50,835 --> 00:18:51,365
I'M Sorry.

458
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,700
I Can'T Really Say More,
But It'S Nothing About Us.

459
00:18:53,735 --> 00:18:54,265
Okay.

460
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,200
I Was Having A Lot Of Fun, Though.

461
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,000
All Right.

462
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,200
Bye.

463
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
I'M Sorry, Mom.
I Have To Go.

464
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:01,065
Oh, Of Course.

465
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,565
You'Re Such A Good Friend.

466
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,200
Look, Um, I Hope You Don'T Mind,
But My Daughter Has To Go.

467
00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:06,100
Do You Need To Go With Her?

468
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,100
No, No, No, Mom.
Stay.

469
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,400
Have Fun, Please.

470
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,665
Thanks, Guys.

471
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,600
It Was Nice To Meet You.

472
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,200
Is She Gonna Be Okay?

473
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,765
Yeah, Uh, Yeah.

474
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,100
I Don'T Think
It Has Anything To Do With Her,

475
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,300
But, Um, You Were
Talking About Your Ranch.

476
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,200
Did You Have Any Horses?

477
00:19:20,235 --> 00:19:21,700
Yes, I Had A Few.

478
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,200
Um, I Had My Own, Rosewood.

479
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,800
My Dad Has A Song Called "Rosewood. "

480
00:19:25,835 --> 00:19:26,965
Oh, But No, Not That Rosewood.

481
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,900
I Completely Forgot About That Song.

482
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:29,865
Yeah, It'S About My Mom.

483
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,700
You Know, 'Cause She Had This Perfume
That She Always Wore.

484
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:33,000
- And It Was Rose And...
- Sandalwood.

485
00:19:33,035 --> 00:19:33,665
Sandalwood.

486
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,300
It Was Like Her Own Personal Scent.

487
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,000
I'M A Fool.

488
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,700
You'Re Not A Fool.

489
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,900
Um, Raise Your Hand If You'Re Over 30
And Acting Really Weird Right Now.

490
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,365
I'M Sorry, Alison.

491
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,500
I Never Told Rufus
About That Horse.

492
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,800
So I'M Sure It'S Just A Coincidence.

493
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,100
Wait A Minute Here.

494
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,400
Why Are You Talking
Like You Know Each Other?

495
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,600
Do You Two Know Each Other?

496
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,700
Uh, We Kinda Did Know Each Other,
A Long, Long Time Ago.

497
00:20:13,735 --> 00:20:14,600
What?

498
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,900
Know Each Other How?

499
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,600
Oh, My God.

500
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,165
This Is Unbelievable.

501
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,400
You Know What?
I Need Some Air.

502
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:30,400
Don'T Follow Me.

503
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,000
You Have A Lot Of Explaining To Do.

504
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,600
Mom, Wait.

505
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,200
May We Please Be Excused?

506
00:20:43,235 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah, Sure.

507
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,765
Watch It.
Come On. Come On. Come On.

508
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,600
I Don'T Want A Bath.
Thanksgiving.Last Year.

509
00:21:05,635 --> 00:21:06,665
Oh, Too Bad.
Thanksgiving.Last Year.

510
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,100
Blair'S Direct Orders.
Thanksgiving.Last Year.

511
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:09,800
- Blair'S Not The Boss Of Me.
- Sit.

512
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:10,665
Oh, Are You New Here?

513
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,100
'Cause Blair'S The Boss
Of All Of Us.

514
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,900
Oh, Seriously, Serena,
You Smell Like The Floor Of A Brewery.

515
00:21:15,935 --> 00:21:17,900
- I Do Not.
- Yes, You Do.

516
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,100
Oh, My God.
Yes, I Do.

517
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,465
Yeah.

518
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,400
Brewery Floor With A Hint Of
Secondhand Smoke?

519
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,765
And A Pint Of Old Spice.

520
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,200
- Whoa.
- I Totally Need A Bath.

521
00:21:30,235 --> 00:21:31,600
Yeah, Deal With It.

522
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,665
Please.

523
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,600
Blair'S A Bossy Genius.

524
00:21:34,635 --> 00:21:35,800
Oh, Yes, She Is.

525
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,000
So What About You?

526
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,965
What About Me?

527
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,800
I Don'T Smell Like An Ashtray.

528
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:43,600
But You Look Like An Ass Tray.

529
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:44,865
Hey, Serena.

530
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,100
Stop, Stop, Stop.

531
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:47,300
Stop, Serena.

532
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,065
Serena, Stop.

533
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,100
What'S Wrong With You?

534
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,900
God.

535
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,200
Oh. Ow.

536
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,400
God.

537
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,565
Aah!Go Away!

538
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,765
Oh, What, What, What, What, What?

539
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,600
- You Started It, Dude.
- You Started It.

540
00:21:57,635 --> 00:21:58,165
Oh!

541
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,365
- What?
- Stop It!

542
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,600
What Are You Guys Doing?

543
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,850
Uh...

544
00:22:04,885 --> 00:22:06,400
Um...

545
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,000
Aah!

546
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,200
My Hair!

547
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
I Got You Both!

548
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,300
I'M King Of The World.

549
00:22:19,335 --> 00:22:21,200
I'M King Of The World!

550
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,800
Hey, It'S Me.

551
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,500
I Didn'T Mean For It To Happen.

552
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,500
I Didn'T See Your Dad Downstairs.

553
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,100
My Mother Just Decides
Everything, You Know?

554
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,000
Everything In The World
Is Just Totally Up To Her.

555
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,100
I Know.

556
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,000
Hey, Why Don'T We Get Out Of Here?

557
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,600
I'M Not Going Back To That Party.

558
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,165
No, I Mean, Outta Here, Outta Here.

559
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Out Of This Apartment,
To A Place A Little More Sane.

560
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,300
Any Place Would Qualify.

561
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,200
So You Actually Threatened 
Lily Van Der Woodsen
With Physical Violence?

562
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,600
Mom, You Are A Badass.

563
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,365
Yeah, Well, What Can I Say?

564
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,400
I Was Younger Then
And Wearing Steel-Toed Boots.

565
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,600
No, No.

566
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,700
No, We Never Actually Came To Blows.

567
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,500
I Focused On
Transforming My Anger Into Art.

568
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:17,765
I Made Some Collages.

569
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,965
I Wrote A Trilogy Of 1-Act Plays
About Her,

570
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,800
Named The Character Milly,
To Try To Be, You Know, Subtle.

571
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,000
It'S Clever.

572
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,065
So What Was So Bad About Her?

573
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,100
And I Mean Aside From The Superior
Fluttering Eyelids And Punishing Sarcasm.

574
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,900
Well, Uh, She Was
Your Dad'S First Great Love,

575
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,200
As She Liked To
Remind Me Every Chance She Got.

576
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,800
It'S Kind Of Hard
To Compete With That.

577
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,050
You'Ve Uh, Been In Here
For A Half-Hour.

578
00:24:56,085 --> 00:24:58,192
Yeah, Well,
Not Nearly Enough Time To Fathom

579
00:24:58,227 --> 00:25:00,300
How You Allowed Me
To Walk Into This Situation.

580
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,000
Allowed You?
Th-

581
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,000
You Were The Last Person I Expected
To Come Through My Front Door Today.

582
00:25:06,035 --> 00:25:07,265
Yeah, Well, At The Very Least,

583
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,565
You Knew That Serena Would Come Home

584
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:14,000
And Tell Me All About The Wonderful Thanksgiving
She Had With Dan, His Father, Oh, And His Mother.

585
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,100
Is This Really How You Think
I Deserve To Find Out?

586
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,900
I Don'T Know What I Do
Or Do Not Owe You.

587
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,600
I Mean, We Haven'T Actually Defined
What We Are To Each Other.

588
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,400
Well, Maybe This Is
The Perfect Opportunity To Do It.

589
00:25:33,435 --> 00:25:34,200
But, Lily...

590
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,700
These Past Few Weeks Have...

591
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,200
Have Been What?

592
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,600
You Can'T Even Say It, Can You?

593
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,800
I Can, But I Shouldn'T.

594
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,500
Look, For Better, For Worse,
You'Re One Of My Oldest Friends.

595
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,000
Oldest Friends?

596
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,700
That'S Certainly Not How It Felt
When You Kissed Me At Eleanor'S Party.

597
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,600
What?

598
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,000
Alison, Honey...

599
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,965
Dan, Will You Go And...

600
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,300
Uh, Check On Jenny And Eric.

601
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,500
Yeah.

602
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,050
Mom, Where'S Dad?

603
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:26,965
How Dare You Do That.

604
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Leave In The Middle
Of Thanksgiving Dinner?

605
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,400
I Need To Talk To Dad.

606
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,400
Dad?

607
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,300
Dad?

608
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,400
Oh, My God.

609
00:26:34,435 --> 00:26:35,565
Dad.

610
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,000
Mom, Call 9-1-1.

611
00:26:37,035 --> 00:26:37,700
Hurry!

612
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,900
Dad, Please, Wake Up.

613
00:26:38,935 --> 00:26:39,600
Dad!

614
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,100
Dorita.

615
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,065
Thanksgiving.

616
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,565
Easy.
Thanksgiving.Last Year.

617
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,700
- Take A Seat, Honey.
- Oh, Goodness.

618
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:48,167
Oh, How Do I Smell Now?

619
00:26:48,202 --> 00:26:49,565
Uh, You Smell Fantastic,

620
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,300
But You Might Not Wanna
Keep Asking People That.

621
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,750
Serena, You Look Wonderful.

622
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:53,942
That Shirt Was Made For You.

623
00:26:53,977 --> 00:26:55,065
Actually, It Was Made For You.

624
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,900
Well, I Knew
There Was A Reason I Liked It.

625
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,300
Yours, Too, I See.

626
00:26:58,335 --> 00:26:58,965
And Mine.

627
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,650
- No, No, No, No.
- Oh, No, No, No.

628
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,300
Would You Help Me With The Potatoes?

629
00:27:02,335 --> 00:27:03,100
Yes.

630
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,250
Don'T Tell Me It'S A Big Deal.

631
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:08,492
I'M Well Aware Of The Stakes.

632
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:09,700
Hey. Who'S Dad Talking To?

633
00:27:09,735 --> 00:27:10,267
What Now?

634
00:27:10,302 --> 00:27:10,765
The Office.

635
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,700
Something About That Deal
With The Dutch Company.

636
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,300
So It Looks Like I'Ll Have To
Slip Out For A Few Minutes.

637
00:27:15,335 --> 00:27:16,367
Dad, It'S A Holiday.

638
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:17,365
Not In Amsterdam.

639
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,765
Well, We Are In America.

640
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,100
Tell Them It Will Wait
Till Tomorrow.

641
00:27:20,135 --> 00:27:21,300
Sweetheart, I Don'T Want To Go.

642
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:22,300
I Have To.

643
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,500
I Brought This Deal In,

644
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,700
But If Meltzer Closes It Without Me,
I Don'T Get The Commission.

645
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,465
Forget The Commission.

646
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,900
I'Ll Write You A Check Myself.

647
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,800
Sit.
We'Re Just About To Eat.

648
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,300
I Think I Just Lost My Appetite.

649
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,200
Your Father And His Headaches.

650
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:53,065
Give The Man Some Gravy.

651
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,400
Probably Took The Vicodin
And Forgot.

652
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,165
Had Some Whiskey,
And The Next Thing You Know-

653
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,500
Mom, Seriously, Did You Hear Anything
The Doctor Said?

654
00:28:00,535 --> 00:28:02,800
With What He Took,
He Could Have Cured 30 Headaches.

655
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,300
Mom, He'S Got A Problem,
And Ignoring It Almost Killed Him.

656
00:28:07,335 --> 00:28:08,200
Oh, No.

657
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,000
This Is Not My Fault.

658
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,665
I'M Not Blaming Anybody.

659
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,365
You Can Blame Whoever You Want,
Just Not Me.

660
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,500
All I'M Guilty Of
Is Trying To Make His Life Easier.

661
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:16,300
Easier?

662
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,400
You'Ve Made His Life Impossible.

663
00:28:18,435 --> 00:28:19,400
What Do You Mean?

664
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,200
He'S Had Everything He Ever Wanted
Just Handed To Him.

665
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,165
My Father Set Him Up
With His Own Firm.

666
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,000
He Gave Us The House That We Live In,
The Hamptons, The Boat.

667
00:28:27,035 --> 00:28:27,965
He'S Never Had To Earn A Dime,

668
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And How Do You Think
That'S Working Out For Him, Mom, Huh?

669
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
Wake Up!

670
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
All He Had To Do
Was Sit Behind A Desk,

671
00:28:35,835 --> 00:28:37,667
Put On A Suit And Not Get Arrested,

672
00:28:37,702 --> 00:28:39,465
And He Couldn'T Manage To Do That.

673
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,900
You Want Me To Give Him
More Responsibility In The Family?

674
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,400
Look, I Don'T Know What The Answer Is,

675
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,100
But We Can'T Keep Going On Like This,
Or Else We'Ll Lose Him.

676
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,900
Excuse Me.

677
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,300
Sorry To Interrupt,
But Mr. Archibald Is Awake.

678
00:28:58,335 --> 00:28:59,265
He Was Asking For You.

679
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,400
- Thank You.
- You'Re Welcome.

680
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,400
I'Ll Go See How He'S Doing.

681
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,300
No.

682
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,500
I Will.

683
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,565
I'M Not Saying
You'Re Overreacting Per Se,

684
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,950
Just Having A Reaction That Is Above
And Beyond What Is Appropriate.

685
00:29:20,985 --> 00:29:23,300
I Have Been Killing Myself Trying
To Make Upfor What Happened In Hudson.

686
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:24,665
Which Is Not An Overreaction,
I Might Add.

687
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,700
And Then I Find Out That The Two Of You
Are Making Out At Theme Parties?

688
00:29:27,735 --> 00:29:31,200
Oh, It Was Hardly Making Out,
And There Is An Explanation.

689
00:29:31,235 --> 00:29:32,200
Hey, Guys.
I'M Back, And I...

690
00:29:32,235 --> 00:29:33,400
Brought... Blair.

691
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,600
Hey.

692
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,500
Wow.

693
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,800
Weird Vibe.

694
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,900
Okay.

695
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,500
Where'S Dan?

696
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,300
There'S No Chance
We'Re Related, Right?

697
00:29:44,335 --> 00:29:45,300
Oh, Look At Eric'S Roots.

698
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:45,865
What Do You Mean?

699
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,100
What'S Wrong With My Roots?

700
00:29:47,135 --> 00:29:48,300
They'Re Kind Of Rufus-Like.

701
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,065
Hey.

702
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,700
Serena And Blair.

703
00:29:50,735 --> 00:29:51,500
Blair?

704
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,065
Yeah, It'S Me.

705
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,765
Explanation To Follow,

706
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,100
But First,
What'S Going On With Our Parents?

707
00:29:56,135 --> 00:29:57,617
Oh, Uh, Our Dad Dated Your Mom.

708
00:29:57,652 --> 00:29:59,100
Yeah, We'Re Not Related, Though.

709
00:29:59,135 --> 00:29:59,565
What?

710
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,700
Ignore My Roots.

711
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,165
Wait.
Wait. What?

712
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,800
You Know What'S Really Weird?

713
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
There'S A Garage Door
In The Middle Of Your Room.

714
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,500
Oh.

715
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,000
Is That Cedric?

716
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,600
Wow. This Day Just Got A Lot Worse.

717
00:30:12,635 --> 00:30:13,065
Hold On.

718
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,765
How Serious Were They-Our Parents?

719
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,900
Uh, I Think It'S Safe To Say
That They Have Had Sex.

720
00:30:17,935 --> 00:30:18,600
Oh.

721
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,465
No, No, No.

722
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,365
No, I'M Gonna Faint.

723
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,265
To Repeat, We Are Not Related.

724
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,300
She Was A Groupie,
And He Was Almost Famous.

725
00:30:24,335 --> 00:30:26,565
Suddenly, My Family Seems So Sane.

726
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,500
This Is Too Much To Handle
On An Empty Stomach.

727
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,400
Well, We'Re Not
Going Back Out There, So...

728
00:30:30,435 --> 00:30:32,500
Well, Can We
Leave Here Then, Please?

729
00:30:32,535 --> 00:30:33,165
Escape.

730
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,800
I Don'T Know.
Maybe Eat?

731
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,600
Well, That'S Why
They Call It A Fire Escape.

732
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,065
I Think We'Re
Splitting Hairs Here, Rufus.

733
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,800
An Emotional Affair
Is Just As Bad As A-As A Physical One.

734
00:30:41,835 --> 00:30:43,265
Oh, Please, Nobody'S Buying That.

735
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,700
Emotional Affairs Are Necessary
To Keep A Marriage Alive.

736
00:30:45,735 --> 00:30:47,200
And How Many Times
Have You Been Divorced?

737
00:30:47,235 --> 00:30:48,900
Alison, This Is Not About Lily.

738
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,100
This Is About You And Me.

739
00:30:50,135 --> 00:30:51,065
Exactly,

740
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,400
And If We'Re Gonna Have Any Chance,
Then She Can'T Be Here.

741
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:54,600
What, For Thanksgiving?

742
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,100
Or Ever?

743
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,700
Oh, You Can'T Be Serious.

744
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:00,600
I Am.

745
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,000
Look, I Have Made Mistakes,
And I Know That,

746
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,500
But If She'S In Your Life,
You'Re Never Gonna Get Over Her.

747
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:08,065
Alison.

748
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,465
This Is It, Rufus, Okay?

749
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,500
If You Wanna Make This Work,
Then You Have To Make A Choice.

750
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,700
Mom, Is Such A Hypocrite, And All These Years,
She'S Been Riding Me About My Behavior.

751
00:31:26,735 --> 00:31:28,265
And Here She'S Just
Mad At You For Being Her.

752
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,100
And All This Time, My Dad Has Been Giving Me
This Advice Based On This Girl He Dated.

753
00:31:32,135 --> 00:31:33,900
This Girl-"A Lot Like Serena.

754
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:34,565
It'S Her Mom.

755
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,865
When You Think About It, It Makes Total
Sense That Your Mom Was A Groupie.

756
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,100
I Mean, Only A Woman That Had Completely
Satisfied Her Sexual Appetite In Her Youth

757
00:31:40,135 --> 00:31:42,065
Would Ever Marry Your Stepdads.

758
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,700
- Blair, Can We Not Talk About Mom'S Appetite?
- Yeah.

759
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,100
Or Who- Or Who Satisfied It.

760
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:45,700
It'S Just...

761
00:31:45,735 --> 00:31:46,417
So...

762
00:31:46,452 --> 00:31:47,376
Gross.

763
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:48,300
Yeah.

764
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,965
Hi.

765
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,100
Hey, Mom.

766
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,500
Is Everything Okay?

767
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,000
Yeah.

768
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100
Do You-Do You Wanna Go Home?

769
00:31:58,135 --> 00:31:59,267
We Could Call A Car.

770
00:31:59,302 --> 00:32:00,400
Oh, No, Not Yet.

771
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,300
Um, I Need Fries.

772
00:32:02,335 --> 00:32:03,065
Excuse Me.

773
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,400
Could I Get Some French Fries?

774
00:32:04,435 --> 00:32:06,067
And Just Keep 'Em Coming.

775
00:32:06,102 --> 00:32:07,700
Sure. Coming Right Up.

776
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,100
Uh, We Should- Jenny And I Should
Probably Head Back To The Loft.

777
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,100
I'M Gonna Go, Too.

778
00:32:15,135 --> 00:32:16,500
Leave You Guys Alone.

779
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,800
S.

780
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,200
Thank You For Today.

781
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,265
The Sandwich Was Delicious.

782
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,500
I'M Calling Dr. Sherman Tomorrow.

783
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,700
- Bye.
- Bye.

784
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,865
Is That Really Necessary, Mom?

785
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,400
From What I Hear, You Have Been
In Places Far Dirtier Than This.

786
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,300
Well...

787
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,700
Please.

788
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:57,600
Try Spending Nine Hours With
Jane'S Addiction On The Ohio Turnpike.

789
00:32:57,635 --> 00:32:59,700
Then We'Ll Talk About Dirty.

790
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,300
Okay.

791
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,800
See You Later, Waldorf.

792
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,300
So, Uh, So Today Was Not Boring.

793
00:33:13,335 --> 00:33:14,500
No.

794
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,500
I Never Should Have Asked Mom To Come Home,

795
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,300
But I Didn'T See This Coming.

796
00:33:20,335 --> 00:33:21,165
Who Could'Ve?

797
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,600
Don'T Worry About It.

798
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,700
It'S So Weird To Think That
Our Parents Had Lives Before Us, You Know?

799
00:33:25,735 --> 00:33:29,000
I Know, Or That They Had Lives
Before Each Other, Huh?

800
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,400
Lily Seemed Pretty Upset.

801
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,200
I Wonder What Happened
While We Were Gone.

802
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,900
Uh, I-I Don'T Know, But It Looks Like
We'Re About To Find Out.

803
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:39,465
Hey!

804
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,900
Who'S In The Mood For A Little
Humphrey Family Scrimmage?

805
00:33:41,935 --> 00:33:42,365
What'Ll It Be?

806
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,450
Kids Against The Parents?

807
00:33:43,485 --> 00:33:44,465
Boys Against The Girls?

808
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,600
Oh, Definitely Girls Against The Boys
Because Last Year,

809
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:48,465
I Got Burned
By Dan'S Weak Forward Pass.

810
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,900
Hey, Hey, I Was Nursing
A Rotator Cuff Injury From Aught-5.

811
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,265
Come On, Mom.

812
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,500
Let'S Go Work Out Our Plays.

813
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:55,400
Yep.

814
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,265
So, Uh, Dad, Not That I'M-
Not That I'M Mad, Exactly,

815
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,600
But Not Telling Me About
Serena'S Mom Was Extremely Uncool.

816
00:34:05,635 --> 00:34:07,500
I Should'Ve Said Something, I Know.

817
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,865
And I'M Sorry.

818
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,865
Given The Ick Factor Alone,

819
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,400
I Would Say That You Set My Progress Back
By At Least Several Months.

820
00:34:13,435 --> 00:34:14,600
Oh, Come On.

821
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,100
You'Re A Humphrey Man.

822
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,500
No Daughter Of Lily'S Could Ever Resist.

823
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,200
How'D You Leave It Back There With Her?

824
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,800
Well, I Wouldn'T Be Expecting Lil
Over For Dinner Anytime Soon.

825
00:34:25,835 --> 00:34:29,100
Your Mom And I Need To
Focus On The Future, Not The Past.

826
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,200
That'S A Lot Easier For
All Of Us Without Her Around.

827
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,000
Well...

828
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,400
Well, Let'S Play
With The Old Pigskin Then.

829
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,000
Mom.

830
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,750
Here You Are.

831
00:34:54,785 --> 00:34:56,065
And Here You Are.

832
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,100
You Had Me Worried Sick.

833
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,100
Blair, Uh...

834
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,200
I Know I-I Shouldn'T Have Lied
To You About Your Father.

835
00:35:05,235 --> 00:35:07,300
That Never Stopped You Before.

836
00:35:07,335 --> 00:35:08,600
True.

837
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,100
But...

838
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,700
The Real Truth...

839
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,900
Divorce Papers From Your Father,
And I'M Supposed To Sign Them.

840
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,200
I Haven'T Yet.

841
00:35:20,235 --> 00:35:21,400
Mom...

842
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,500
He'S Living In Europe...

843
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,000
With A Man.

844
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,665
You Can'T Be All That Surprised
That He Wants A Divorce.

845
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:39,400
I'M Not, But What I- What I Am Surprised
About Is How It Makes Me Feel.

846
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,700
He Was My Husband, After All.

847
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,400
My Harold...

848
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,100
For Almost 20 Years.

849
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,000
I Couldn'T Face Him...

850
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,665
During The Holidays.

851
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,200
It Was Always Our Happiest Time.

852
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,700
Why Didn'T You Just Tell Me That?

853
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,950
And Let You Choose
Between The Two Of Us?

854
00:36:04,985 --> 00:36:07,492
I Wonder Who Would'Ve Won That Battle.

855
00:36:07,527 --> 00:36:10,000
Yeah, I Would Have Been Entirely Alone.

856
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,100
Well, Uh, I Was Anyway.

857
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,400
It'S Still Thanksgiving.

858
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,000
Yeah.

859
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,600
What Do You Want To Do?

860
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,465
Hey.

861
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,200
Oh, You'Re Still Here.

862
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,365
I Guess I Must Have Fallen Back Asleep.

863
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Yeah, You Were, Uh, You Were Pretty Out
Of It When I First Came In.

864
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,500
Where'S Your Mom?

865
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,400
She'S Getting Coffee.

866
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,600
How'S Your Mom?

867
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,300
She'S Gonna Be All Right.

868
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,000
We All Are.

869
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,700
So...

870
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,800
Vicodin And Whiskey, Huh?

871
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,000
I Guess I Forgot I Took That Medicine
When I Took That Drink.

872
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:26,200
Dad, We'Re Not Doing This Anymore.

873
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,400
Okay? We'Re Just Not.

874
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,700
I Know It Wasn'T An Accident.

875
00:37:33,735 --> 00:37:34,465
Of Course It Was.

876
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,800
And When I Found You,
I Thought You Were Dead.

877
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,500
I'M Sorry.

878
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,400
I Just Didn'T...

879
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,700
I Couldn'T- Yes, You Can.

880
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,900
Dad, You Have To, Please.

881
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,600
I Know It Might Not
Always Feel That Way, But...

882
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,300
We Need You.

883
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,000
Dad, We Need You.

884
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,600
Here You Go, Nate.

885
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,200

00:39:37,035 --> 00:39:37,900
Just Say It.

910
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,400

911
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,500
Hey, Dan, Will You Pass The Mashed?

00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,800

I'M Sorry.

00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,565
You'Re Asleep At The Wheel.

916
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,700
The Humphrey Family Thanksgiving Dinner'S
A Well-Oiled Machine.

917
00:40:08,735 --> 00:40:10,300
Were You Still Thinking About
Your Dream Girl?

918
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,400
What?

919
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,300
No.

920
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,365
No, No.

921
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,900
I'M Thinking About, Um,

922
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,165
Your Stuffing, Mom,

923
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,550

Well, Keep Dreaming.

926
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,200
You Know, Maybe One Day
She'Ll Actually Know Your Name.

00:40:22,235 --> 00:40:23,000
Yeah, Maybe,

928
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,300
And Then I'Ll Have Something
To Be Thankful For.

929
00:40:25,335 --> 00:40:26,100
Oh, Shut Up.

930
00:40:26,135 --> 00:40:26,900
