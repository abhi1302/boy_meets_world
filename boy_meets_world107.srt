we can take 'em...

off his flowers
and use them for bait...

it's a simple flick...

00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,751
She's your age.
She'll need to be entertained...

178
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,915
And I thought that maybe
you could help me out.

179
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,824
Look, I'd love to meet

your niece, Mr. Feeny,

180
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,455
But, see, I got this really bad
case of strep throat.

181
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:53,523
It's spreading down my lungs
and into my pancreas...

182
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:57,900
so, as you can see,
I'm--I'm completely strep.

183
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,565
Relax.
I'm merely curious...

184
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:05,044
as to how a contemporary
teenage girl entertains herself.

185
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,808
oh, oK. Well,

it's my experience...

186
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,815
that if they can't find
a senior with a car...

187
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,749
they'll settle for
some gullible sophomore...

188
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,514
who's willing
to empty his pockets...

189
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,111
on a dinner
he can't really afford...

190
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,588
a movie
he doesn't want to see...

191
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,784
and a door
slammed in his face.

192
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,794
Somewhere in that
brimming cup of bile...

193
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,762
I heard dinner and a movie.

194
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,230
Yeah, see,

dinner and a movie...

195
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,199
is the premier form
of dating entertainment.

196
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,825
Dinner, movie. Movie, dinner.

197
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,302
Dinner, dinner, movie, movie.

198
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,898
A wonderfully rich tapestry
of human experience.

199
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,138
Don't mock what I am,

Mr. Feeny.

200
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,539
Mom, where's Grandma?

201
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,380
We were supposed
to leave ten minutes ago...

202
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,249
and her Winnebago's
not even outside.

203
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,584
You know what, Cor?

204
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,589
I was gonna bake
some blueberry muffins.

205
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,056
You want to help me?

206
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,354
-Bake?
-Mm-hmm.

207
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,883
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

208
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,055
There's nothing
I'd rather do more.

209
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,564
oh, wait. I'm lying.

210
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,623
I'd rather go to Baltimore.

211
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,897
Well, how about just
until you leave?

212
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,996
ohh...so how long
do you think...

213
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,973
I could go
without taking a shower...

214
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,134
before my arm gets
all gross disgusting?

215
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:14,044
Is this what's gonna happen
to me when my hormones kick in?

216
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,049
Yeah, like I don't have anything
else on my mind but girls.

217
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,280
Look, I got a lot of other
things on my mind besides girls.

218
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,753
A lot of other things.
There's, like--

219
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,552
Girl! Girl! Right there!
Right there!

220
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:25,558
Where?

221
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:27,890
It's Feeny's niece.
She's unbelievable.

222
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,485
I--I gotta think.
I gotta think.

223
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,396
I got to take her to a world
she's never been to before.

224
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,059
Dinner. Movie.
Movie. Dinner.

225
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,863
This has to be perfectly
orchestrated, or else--

226
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:36,891
Weasel!

227
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:45,300
oK, weasel, do you remember
what we've been practicing?

228
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,939
This is my brother Eric.

229
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,347
He's very shy.

230
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,441
Ha ha.

231
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,087
Perfect. Look,

in exactly one minute...

232
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,452
I want you to come outside...

233
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,751
and do what we've been doing
at the mall.

234
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,417
How will I know
when it's a minute?

235
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,888
oK? Minute, ding.
Minute, ding.

236
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,056
Minute, ding.

237
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,725
Movie, dinner.

Movie, dinner.

238
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,197
How you doing, Mr. Feeny?

239
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,170
How could I help you
in the garden today?

240
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,331
oh.

241
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,073
oh, hi. I'm Eric.

242
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,408
I'm Jessica.

243
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,073
Strep throat cleared up,
did it, Mr. Matthews?

244
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,707
Strep throat?
A guy like me?

245
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,741
No. See, I work out

much too hard...

246
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,616
to ever get strep throat.

247
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,349
So, uh, where would you
like me to move...

248
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,084
this enormously heavy bag
of fertilizer?

249
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,115
I hadn't planned
on moving it at all.

250
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,617
Let me just effortlessly
toss it over here, then.

251
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:37,755
Hoo-dah!

252
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,130
[Bell dings]

253
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,033
This is my brother Eric.

254
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,067
He's very shy.

255
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,274
Speaking of fertilizer.

256
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,316
Is this your little sister?

257
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,318
That she is.

258
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,820
I love Eric.

259
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,049
oh, please. Jessica...

260
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,648
you couldn't possibly fall
for this line of--

261
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,058
She is so cute.

262
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,584
And so well-rehearsed.

263
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,592
Eric's taking me
to the carnival today.

264
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,123
When did I say that?

265
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:19,867
Ha ha. Looks like your parrot
has learned a few new words.

266
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,965
Do you want to come with us?

267
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,703
oh, with us.

268
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,075
To the carnival with us, yes.

269
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,409
Please come With us.

270
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,610
Well, if that's oK with you,
Uncle George.

271
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,242
Well, I think

the polite thing...

272
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:36,244
would be to extend an invitation
for me to join you.

273
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:41,152
Mr. Feeny, would you like
to come to the carnival with us?

274
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,130
oh, thank you so very
much for asking...

275
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:49,999
but no. I'd rather
have gum surgery.

276
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,674
oK, now, remember

to take those out...

277
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,703
in a couple minutes
so they don't stick.

278
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:05,013
Mom, I kind of got the hang
of it in the last four batches.

279
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,951
Is Grandma lost or What?

280
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,977
I don't know, Cor,

but, hey...

281
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:11,081
you know what?
I was gonna bake a cake next.

282
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,591
You want to help me out?

283
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,616
Look, Mom, I know

you're trying to do this...

284
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,026
to distract me and all...

285
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,689
but what if something
happened to Grandma?

286
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,754
Maybe we should call
the police.

287
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,266
-No, I don't think so.

-Why not?

288
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,292
Because I'm sure
that she's fine.

289
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,304
Then why isn't she here yet?

290
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,896
Honey, I've known
your grandmother...

291
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,100
for a long time,
and there's something...

292
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,905
you need to understand
about her.

293
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,275
I understand that
if Grandma's not here yet...

294
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,247
she must have
a very good reason.

295
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:44,082
She's not coming, is she?

296
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,522
I'm sorry, Cory.

297
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,054
I knowthis is disappointing.

298
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,624
Eh, it was just
a stupid road trip.

299
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,694
I mean, what kind of city
is Baltimore, anyway?

300
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,137
An American League city.

301
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:04,075
Hey, why don't you call Shawn?
See if he wants to go bowling.

302
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,738
-Cool. I'll drive.
-or I'll drive.

303
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,770
That could work, too.

304
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:11,283
I'll call my best bud Shawn...

305
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,842
the one guy I can count on
to be there.

306
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,980
Hi, Mrs. Hunter?

It's Cory. Shawn around?

307
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,491
What do you mean,
he's gone fishing?

308
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,959
Did you know your husband's
cheating on me...

309
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,121
with someone else's son?

310
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,757
You forgot to call Shawn.

311
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,029
Good-bye, Mrs. Hunter.

312
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,631
I forgot.

313
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,403
You didn't tell him you weren't
going on the fishing trip?

314
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,603
I forgot.

315
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,612
So he still showed up.

316
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,614
I guess he didn't forget.

317
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,276
Now he's out there
with my dad...

318
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,513
drinking root beer,
eating potato chips...

319
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,111
bonding away.

320
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,385
I miss one thing
with my dad...

321
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:55,520
and he drops me
for the first available son.

322
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,461
Where are you going?

323
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,294
I'll be in the tree house.

324
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,492
Hold my calls.

325
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:09,072
MORGAN: Eric is the best
brother in the whoLe worLd.

326
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,208
That's enough, Morgan.

327
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,874
That was so sweet of you to play
four hours of skeeball...

328
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,280
just to win her that giraffe.

329
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,080
3,000 tickets.

330
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,781
Eric's gonna give me
his new sunglasses.

331
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,187
No, he's not.

332
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,817
You know, you can really
tell a lot about a guy...

333
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,520
by the way
he treats his sister.

334
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,324
oh, you mean these.

335
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,024
There you go.

336
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,859
Eric is such
a good-looking boy.

337
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,201
Yeah, thanks.

338
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,138
Are we all done for the day?

339
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,642
Yes, we're done. Bye-bye.

340
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,705
She's adorable.

341
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,340
She's not the only one.

342
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,443
Who's Graziella Terziana?

343
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:54,851
What?

344
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,084
Her name,

it's written on your arm.

345
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,955
Uh, that--

346
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:04,122
I can't stop every girl
who wants to sign my body.

347
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,323
oh, Mr. Charming.

348
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,332
I could loan you a pen.

349
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,833
And smart, too,

350

Using his little sister
as date bait like that.

351
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,428
That obvious, huh?

352
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,031
oh, yeah. Heh.

353
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,336
Big mistake?

354
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,433
Did I say that?

00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,377
So I didn't have
to work so hard.

Well, we're just,
uh, passing through.

360

or are we all done here?

Everyone have
a great day without me?

365
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,783
How long have you
been up there?

366
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:07,452
Long enough to watch you
swap spit with a Feeny.

367
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,390
Well, I'd say the mood
is sufficiently killed...

368

Dead and buried.

370

I think my little sister's
busy tomorrow...

371
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,671

it's just you and me.

372
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,263
I'll bring the pen.

373
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,706
Good night.

374
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,607
Everyone. Ha ha.

375
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,080
She's related to Feeny?

376
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,478
Niece.

377
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:33,951

of a list of what, two?

What are you doing back
from Baltimore so early?

384
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,004
-I didn't go to Baltimore.
-Why not?

385
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:02,344
'Cause I stayed here all day
'cause Grandma dumped me...

386

while my best friend was out
Stealing my dad.

387
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,153
oh, grow up.
I wasn't stealing your father.

388
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,781
-Good night, Shawn.
-Night, Dad.

389
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,424
-So Grandma never showed, huh?

-Nah, she didn't.

390
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,428
You want to talk about it?

391
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,657
Doesn't really seem like
there's much to talk about.

392
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,461
Hoo, boy, are you wrong.

393
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,126
Where are you going?

394
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,227
I'm hungry. Shawn ate
everything on the boat...

395
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,737
except the worms.

You made these?

anything else to do...

didn't show up.

to the Franklin
Museum of Science...

that Grandma forgot to return...

414

the permission slip,
so I didn't get to go.

just the way you're feeling now.

-Did you hate her?
-Well, no.

418
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,691
It's kind of hard
to hate her, Cory...

419
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,494
'cause a couple months later,
she woke me up...

420
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,296
in the middle of the night,
she bundles me up...

421
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,927

Grandma took you all the way
to Cape Canaveral?

430
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:52,990
See, Grandma doesn't show love

like other people do...

431
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,959
but she loves you
no matter what you think.

She just shows love
in her own way.

was a mile wide...
