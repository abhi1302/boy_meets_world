00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,543
I have graded last week's
geography examination...

3
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,707
and the highest score
was achieved by--

4
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:18,217
Minkus. Was it achieved
by Minkus?

5
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:21,119
Does it go to Minkus?
Minkus, right?

6
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,951
Mr. Minkus.

7
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:26,186
That's a shock.

8
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,386
Thank you, Mr. Feeny.

9
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:30,590
Your bonus question
was a real stumper. ow.

10
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,599
Miss owens, excellent.

11
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,101
Mr. Baker, very nice.

12
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,602
Mr. Matthews...

13
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:38,332
Well, there it is.

14
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,839
A "C"?

15
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,842
But I actually studied
for this test.

16
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,400
Why did I get a "C"?

17
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,935
Let's see. Where to begin.

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,744
Well, for one thing,
Mr. Matthews...

19
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,013
this section of the map
is not East Germany.

20
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,041
It's not?

21
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,383
Perhaps you heard
of a little incident...

22
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,888
with the Berlin Wall?

23
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:57,948
Was that during
baseball season?

24
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:01,426
There is no
East Germany anymore.

25
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,089
But the textbook says it's
right next to West Germany.

26
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:07,396
Yes, well, the textbook also

says that Alaska and Hawaii...

27
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,369
will make fine states someday.

28
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,871

the Board of Education...

30
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,569
doesn't have the funds
to keep up.

31
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,100

supposed to keep up?

As some of you may know,
for the past five years...

50
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,909
I have always fielded
a champion...

51
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,713
and I expect to do
the same this year.

52
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:09,848
So, based on his outstanding
scholastic achievement...

53

I have selected
as this year's entrant--

54
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,553

selected Minkus?

Mr. Minkus.

first prize will be--

to the generational
chasm between us...

115
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,047

possibly be going...

doing in here?

come over, Minkus.

what that means.

every 4 people is a nerd.

around this room...

you change.

Maybe I like how I am.

142
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,467

making fun of you?

00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,667
No.

144
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,335
You like always being the
last one picked for teams?

145
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:51,401
No.

146
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,638

pulling your underwear...

00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,078
up your butt
all the time?

148
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:56,980

The geography tournament--
you don't want to do it.

155
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,330
It'll brand you for life.

156
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,832
But I love geography.

157
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,530
I'm drawn by the adventure
and exoticism of it.

158
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,539
Hey. Perhaps you fellows
would like to join...

what's in it for me.

price, you little creep.

When you guys play
Bombardment...

166
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,451
could you not aim the ball
at my head anymore?

167
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,753
Deal.

168
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,226
What's the point
of playing...

169
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,422
if we can't throw
the ball at his head?

170
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,231
Hi. Who's first?

171
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,858
Dad, you can't go to
the Aerosmith concert.

172
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,096
He's afraid it will
blow out our hearing aids.

173
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,229
I'm just saying
it's unnatural.

174
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,432
I mean can't you guys...

175
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,770
find your own
concert to go to?

176
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,207

I couldn't get tickets...

177
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,766

00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,371
Get a clue! We've been
listening to Aerosmith...

179
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,880
since before you were born.

00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,280
oh, come on,

get out of here.

181
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,341
Don't kill my
first concert, oK?

182
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,683
This isn't your first
Aerosmith concert.

183
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,188
Madison Square Garden, 1978.

184
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,918
We were there,

you were here.

185
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,290
You ate him?

186
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,261
How old are these
Aerosmith guys, anyway...

187
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:17,786
Iike a million?

188
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,560
Yeah, our age.

189
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,861
Row C-C.

190
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,027
Read 'em and Weep.

191
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,435
That's the third row.
These are amazing.

192
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,440
Yeah. old guys
get good seats.

193
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:30,341
Maybe we can buy him
decent seats near us...

194
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,538
so he can at least
see the stage.

195
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,877
I don't want to sit
near you guys, oK?

196
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,973
I don't want to be in the
same amphitheater as you.

197
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,485
I don't even want to hear
the same group as you.

198
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,009
I'll go see if there
are any seats left...

199
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,989
for Eric Clapton.

200
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:44,991
[Door closes]

201
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,220
You want to tell him?

202
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,198
[Bell rings]

203
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,228
Mr. Feeny, I'm afraid I must
tender my resignation...

204
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,865
from the geography tournament.

205
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,069
Mr. Minkus, I'm aware

that the changing...

206
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,873
geopolitical face
of the globe...

207
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,675
offers
a difficult challenge.

208
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,875
I just don't feel that
the geography tournament...

209
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,474
fits in with my new image.

210
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:14,612
And what, pray tell,
would that image be?

211
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,384
Stuart Minkus, regular guy.

212
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,887
Mr. Minkus, I have

always thought of you...

213
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,225
as exceptional.

214
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:26,232
Now, why would you suddenly
settle for regular?

215
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:29,064
Read average,
read mediocre.

216
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,569
Because exceptional people...

217
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,572
get Bombardment balls
thrown at their heads.

218
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:37,372
And regular guys...
do the throwing.

219
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,877
I see.

220
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,039
And I can't
convince you...

221
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,514
to postpone your
new association...

222
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:46,041
with the common man until
after the tournament?

223
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,054
No. I'm seizing the day.

224
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,147
Carpe diem. Mr. Feeny.

225
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:55,054
oh, I'm sorry to hear
that, Mr. Minkus.

226
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,064
You were the only
student I ever had...

227
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,395
who could locate Thrace...

228
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,491
on a map of
the ancient world.

229
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,831
Ah, that's easy.

230
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,666
Just go north
from the Aegean and--

231
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,729
I know what you're doing,
Mr. Feeny...

232
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:11,176
and it isn't going to--
ain't going to work.

233
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,736
I shall miss you,
Mr. Minkus.

234
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,408
I only wish I knew...

235
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,178
how I was going
to replace you.

236
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,380
Come on, Mr. Feeny.

237
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,222
I'm the only game
in town.

238
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,525
Then, Mr. Matthews,

there is no game.

239
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,497
Uh, Mr. Feeny.

240
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,591
I noticed you've
left the classroom...

241
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,999
and turned east.

242
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,003
Towards Europe,
don't you know?

243
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,767
Come on,

give me a chance.

244
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,672
A chance to what,

Mr. Matthews?

245
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,075
To publicly humiliate me?

246
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,840
No. To win for you.

247
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,472
You've never shown
any interest...

248
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,244
in geography before this.

249
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,341
But I do have
an interest...

250
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,750
in winning the
geography tournament.

251
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,720
I can learn anything
when I'm interested in it.

252
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,780
Are you saying
that you're willing...

253
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,655
to learn something from me?

254
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,091
Yeah.

255
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,028
And if anyone can
teach me, you can.

256
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,395
'Cause that's the kind
of teacher you are.

257
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,729
I'm an empty vessel.

258
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,133
How many times have l
heard you say that?

259
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,073
I've lost count.

260
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,406
But I'm willing
to learn from you.

261
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:21,106
How many times have
you heard me say that?

262
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,605
Well...I don't believe
I've ever heard those words...

263
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,949
in that order from you.

264
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:33,489
All right, Mr. Matthews.
I will take you on.

265
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,222
I shall prep you
for the tournament.

266
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,230
I know that your
motives are not pure...

267
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,732
but I hope your
quest for the prize...

268
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,201
will lead you to the
temple of knowledge.

269
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,703
Yeah, yeah.
If it's on the way.

270
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:45,761
Mm-hmm.

271
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,841
I thought we were
going to the park?

272
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,909
Come on, man, you're
studying too much.

273
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,648
The teachers are
starting to notice.

274
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,485
Yeah, they're calling
you a good student.

275
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,185
They're saying
you have potential.

276
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,320
Wow! The highest
and lowest points...

277
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,262
in the continental
United States...

278
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,458
are only 50 miles apart...

279
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,467
Death Valley
and Mount Whitney.

280
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,901
I find that extraordinary.

281
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,068
Extraordinary?

282
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,940
He's mutating, man.

283
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,102
ow.

284
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,451
Hey, dudes. What's up?

285
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,989
Too Weird for me.

286
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,490
I'm out of here.

287
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,492
Hey, my buds
invited me down...

288
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,857
to the sewer pipes
to break bottles.

289
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,521
Want to come?

290
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,030
Minkus, I'm glad
you're here.

291
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,793
I need to use
your brain.

292
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,802
Sorry, my brain
is no longer in service.

293
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,304
I don't want to lose
this bat boy gig.

294
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,169
In the old days, things
used to be so simple.

295
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,072
You had Russia,

you had Moscow--

296
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,667
one country, one capital.

297
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,237
Now you've got your Latvia,
your Estonia, your Ukraine...

298
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,148
and each one has
its own separate capital.

299
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,151
What were
these people thinking?

300
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,153
Help me, Minkus.

301
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,951
You're on your own, dude.

302
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,151
Every time
I think I'm out...

303
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,992
they try to suck me
back in.

304
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,828
You seem to be holding
your own quite nicely.

305
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:23,324
Thanks. Last night I watched
House of StyLe on MTV.

306
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,529
What do you think?

307
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,529
I think Western civilization
is in its decline.

308
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,041
I completely agree.

309
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:33,204
I'm going to watch
Beavis and Butthead now.

310
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,779
So, Mr. Matthews,

how goes the studying?

311
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,514
Great. You know,

I'm really getting into it.

312
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,021
Glad to hear it.

313
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:46,025
I think you're going to
make an admirable bat boy.

314
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,356
I hope so...

315
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,692
but learning all this stuff
is pretty fun, too.

316
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,788
Did you know that Hawaii...

317
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,992
used to be called
the Sandwich lslands?

318
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,230
Really?
That's fascinating.

319
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,738
We're they named
after somebody?

320
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,104
Yes, the Earl of Sandwich.

321
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:06,077
Sandwich?
You don't suppose--

322
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:09,309
yes, he did invent
the sandwich.

323
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,839
Isn't that Weird?

324
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,683
Weird, indeed,

Mr. Matthews.

325
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,456
-The buckeye state?
-ohio.

326
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,461
-The bluegrass state?
-Kentucky.

327
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,588
-Highest mountain in Africa?
-Kilimanjaro.

328
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,063
Elton John.

329
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,066
ours.

330
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,330
-Led Zeppelin.
-oh, please.

331
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,167
-Tina Turner.
-My mother's.

332
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,298
Eric, if it

bothers you so much...

333
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,171
that your mother and I are
going to this concert...

334
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,144
why don't you rebel--
don't go.

335
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:42,113
oh, yeah. I see
your game here.

336
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,343
You'd love it if I didn't
go to that concert...

337
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,851
wouldn't you?
Nice try, Dad.

338
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,183
Heather and I are going
to that concert.

339
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,689
We're going to be there
64 rows behind you...

340
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,452
breathing down your neck.

341
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,799
Are your shoulders
tense, Mr. Matthews?

342
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,599
Yeah, they're
a little tense.

343
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,634
Then I suggest
you go like this...

344
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,505
You should really relax,
Mr. Feeny.

345
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,642
I got a good feeling
about this.

346
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,151
Your trophy's in the bag...

347
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:23,212
and I'm gonna be handing out
bats at the Fall Classic.

348
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,781
Here you are, Mr. Bonds.

349
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,292
Pinch hit for you?

350
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,692
Why, it'd be my pleasure.

351
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,596
Moderator:
Contestant 3...

352
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:37,330
name the indigenous peopLes
of Tierra deL Fuego.

353
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,837
Who are the Yahgans?

354
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,271
It is unnecessary
to phrase your answer...

355
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,673
in the form of a question.

356
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,176
Sorry.

357
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,975
Contestant 4. what
is the primary export...

358
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,481
of the Tuamotus?

359
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,951
Are these guys working
from a different globe?

360
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:56,182
I believe that
would be copra.

361
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,519
Thank you.

362
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:01,323
And contestant 5.
to whom do they beLong?

363
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,328
To whom does who belong?

364
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,727
The Tuamotus.

365
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:09,030
Of what country are
they a possession?

366
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,467
Did you know that Hawaii...

367
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,528
used to be called
the Sandwich lslands...

368
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,164
which were named after
the Earl of Sandwich...

369
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,107
who discovered
peanut butter and jelly?

370
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,543
I'm sorry.
The answer is France.

371
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:24,141
oh, sure. She gets
a no brainer--"Copra."

372
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:28,586
Florida is the southernmost
of the United States.

373
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:32,990
Alaska is the northernmost
of the United States.

374
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,222
Puerto Rico is still
a territory...

375
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,162
so is Guam.

376
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,324
What does a bat boy do?

377
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,833
I don't know.

378
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,837
They hand players bats.
Get it, bat boy?

379
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,839
Well, who would

want to do that?

380
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,841
Yeah. What
a stupid prize.

381
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,035
What ever happened to...

382
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:53,102
the Mercator projection
pull-down wall map?

383
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,814
oh...

384
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,113
I'm hitting my head.

385
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,119
I'm hitting
the northernmost...

386
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,984
part of my head.

387
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,021
So I try not to look
down at row C-C...

388
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,189
because Heather and I are
having a good time, you know?

389
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,028
But I can't help looking.

390
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,296
Are Mom and Dad sitting
in row C-C?

391
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,634
No, Mom and Dad are

dancing in the aisles.

392
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,004
Come on, Eric, I think your
parents are really cool.

393
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,509
oh, good, I'm the lucky boy
with the cool parents.

394
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,307
Your mom was sitting
on your dad's shoulders.

395
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,744
It Was adorable.

396
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,372
I don't want
adorable parents.

397
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,280
Cory, you want
adorable parents?

398
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,342
Nope. I just want them
to make me lunch...

399
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,581
and pick me up
from camp.

400
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,953
oh, I didn't even tell you
the worst thing they did.

401
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,288
What did they do?

402
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:41,588
Hey!

403
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,460
They wore that.

404
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,727
Hot concert, huh?

405
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:47,960
Yeah, hot, Dad.

406
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,195
What's the matter? Didn't
you guys have a good time?

407
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,328
I had a good time.

408
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,428
oh, yeah,
I had a good time.

409
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,631
Time of my life!

410
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:54,799
Come on, Heather.

I'm taking you home.

411
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,673
Eric, what

is the problem?

412
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,905
Well, the problem is
that I've waited all year...

413
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,709
to take Heather
to the Aerosmith concert.

414
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,771
When I finally do...

415
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:03,975
I should be having
the time of my life.

416
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,075
But I'm not.
You know why?

417
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,085
No, why?

418
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,086
Cory.

419
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,419
What? I'm involved.
This is interesting.

420
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,290
Because my parents
are having my good time.

421
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,420
In better seats.

422
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,054
Why should
our good time...

423
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,428
get in the way
of your good time?

424
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,762
You're my parents!

425
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,495
You're not supposed
to have any fun.

426
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:25,299
You're supposed to sit here
and wait for me to get home.

427
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,169
And how come I'm home first?

428
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,833
We had backstage passes.

429
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,342
All right, that's it.
Cory, move over.

430
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,845
I'm sitting next to you
in the loser's couch.

431
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,346
You lost that
geography thing...

432
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,212
and I lost my music,
my parents...

433
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,341
my entire generation.

434
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,852
I studied geography
for the last 300 hours...

435
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,116
and I have nothing
to show for it.

436
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,554
I had to wait
in line all night...

437
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,921
to get those tickets.

438
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,290
The only thing I have
to show for it is...

439
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,125
Sonny and Cher.

440
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:54,530
Eric, I'm sorry, and I know
it's tough to hear this...

441
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,467
but your mother and l
are at an awkward age.

442
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,960
We're parents,
but we're not dead yet.

443
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,133
Fine. Glad somebody
had a good time.

444
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,075
Come on, Heather.

I'm taking you home.

445
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,909
Eric, stop right there.

446
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,541
Sit back in that couch,

both of you.

447
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,074
Join me on the couch,

Heather?

448
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,624
Cory, upstairs.

449
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,558
Why? I'm not remotely tired.

450
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:21,617
Cory.

451
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:25,097
But suddenly, I'm
overcome with fatigue.

452
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,598
Come on, sweetie.

453
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,965
But I want to watch
Eric get yelled at.

454
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,937
Lots of opportunities
for that.

455
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,735
You know, Dad, it really
wouldn't be too cool...

456
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,038
to start yelling at me
in front of my girlfriend.

457
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,737
You know,

when I was your age...

458
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,838
I had a father
like the one you want.

459
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,405
But What I Wanted...

460
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:47,977
was a father like
the one you got.

461
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,510
Live With it.

462
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,651
Did my parents just
leave us alone...together?

463
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,164
Yeah, I think

they just did.

464
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:04,534
I'm the lucky boy
with the cool parents.

465
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,832
Not that cool!

466
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,380
[Bell rings]

467
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,248
Mr. Minkus...

468
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:21,151
I see you've abandoned
your MTV look.

469
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,621
Well, nothing against
Cindy Crawford...

470
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:27,387
but I'm more of a
Connie Chung kind of guy.

471
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:31,658
Well, sometimes a man

doesn't know himself...

472
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,062
until he's walked a mile...

473
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,693
in another man's
humungous pants.

474
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,535
Hey, Minkus.
Who owns the Tuamotus?

475
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,632
France.

476
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:43,699
oh.

477
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:51,640
He would've brought home
the big 6, wouldn't he?

478
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:53,276
Very likely.

479
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:59,121
Well, I want you to know
that I tried my hardest.

480
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:00,716
Did you?

481
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,695
Do you really feel
you gave it your best...

482
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:04,991
that you studied...

483
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,464
as hard as
you possibly could?

484
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,967
Yeah, I do.

485
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:14,428
You know, Mr. Matthews, many
1 5th century explorers...

486
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,306
believed that geography
meant taking...

487
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:20,107
their little boat
as far as it could go...

488
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,842
before it fell
off the earth.

489
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:26,841
You have pushed yourself
to your farthest latitudes.

490
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:29,980
And not only did you not
topple over the edge...

491
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,683
but, I believe, together...

492
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:35,285
we have charted
new territory.

493
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,419
What's this?

494
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:39,022
That is this week's
geography exam.

495
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,793
I got an "A"?

496
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,300
Yes, it's an "A."

497
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,360
Congratulations,
Mr. Matthews.

498
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,244
We won.

499
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,219
Sports announcer:
There are 2 outs...

500
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,386
and Barry Bonds
steps up to the pLate.

501
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,793
The pitcher
winds up and--

502
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,320
Second announcer: Wait.
wait. wait a minute. Ed.

503
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,594
It Looks Like the bat boy is
running out onto the fieLd!

504
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,067
She seems to be
carrying a banner...

505
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,899
and she's hoLding
it up. John.

506
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,235
Gosh. Ed. what's it say?

507
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,935
It says. "Get France
out of the Tuamotus. "

508
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:25,739
Where are
the Tuamotus. Ed?

509
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,439
WeLL. I guess they're
in France. John.

510
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,913
Hey. you know I aLways
thought the Tuamotus...

511
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:32,645
were the indigenous peopLes
of Tierra deL Fuego.

512
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,175
Oh. no. John.

513
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,518
