00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,434
I don't know.
He's more complex than you.

181
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:05,069
Anyway, the point is that we've
made mistakes with money.

182
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,544
Let him make his.

183
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,103
Honey, what are we
supposed to do...

184
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,672
just hang back, do nothing?

185
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:10,944
We are doing something.

186
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,919
We're trusting our child,
and if he makes a mistake...

187
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,217
he'll learn from it.

188
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,349
I have been a parent
for fifteen years...

189
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,154
and I think I know
a little better...

190
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,718
than to trust my own kids.

191
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:26,664
Look, guys,
I feel like a total jerk.

192
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,724
You shouldn't let me
manage my own money.

193
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,895
I'm going to the mall,
see if I can get it back.

194
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,370
Thanks for not
jumping on my case.

195
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,041
That's oK, honey.

196
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,567
I married you for your body.

197
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,343
Look at her,

that black widow spider.

198
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,546
I mean, she spun me
into a web of deceit...

199
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,953
and hung me there
like a dead fly.

200
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,616
She thinks
she can Lure me in...

201
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,717
with her angelic eyes
and swimsuit issue body.

202
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,024
Yeah, well, she can't.

I'm a rock on this.

203
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,586
Eric!

204
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,497
Please don't let me give her
any more of my money.

205
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,830
I'm glad you're back.

206
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,893
I bet you are.
Now, look. I want--

207
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,598
-A job?
-What?

208
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,232
I got a modeling job
for you here at the mall.

209
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,367
oh, sure. What else

do I have to buy, huh?

210
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,537
More modeling classes?
How about a billboard...

211
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,570
a big billboard with
"Eric Matthews is an idiot"...

212
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,741
plastered all over
Philadelphia?

213
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,520
The job pays $50.
If they like you...

214
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,853
I can get you more
the next time.

215
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,655
You're serious?
This is a real modeling job?

216
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,094
Hey, either you want it
or your don't.

217
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,098
You're not the only
gorgeous guy...

218
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,067
with big hazel eyes
here at the mall.

219
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,002
Heh heh.
Actually, they're brown...

220
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,767
but kind of a hazely brown.

221
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,941
You know what the tough thing is
about being married?

222
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,311
Actually being married?

223
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:51,545
Yeah, that. And learning to be
the type of husband...

224
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,176
your wife wants you to be.

225
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,552
Were you going to say something,
sweetheart?

226
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,888
Heh. Not for the last
eighteen years, darling.

227
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,758
Hey, you get your money back?

228
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,163
Better than that.
I got a career.

229
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,599
Excuse me?

230
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,569
Look, Dad, we've spent a lot
of great times together...

231
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,332
and I'll never forget
how well you treated me.

232
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:15,341
Son, are we breaking up?

233
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,343
Well, actually,
I'm leaving my job at the store.

234
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:20,540
I got my first job as a model.
It's just the beginning for me.

235
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,947
I'm, uh, giving you
your apron back.

236
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,016
Thanks for taking it
so well, Dad.

237
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,047
"Don't do anything.

238
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,955
"Let him work it out
for himself."

239
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,550
Fabulous.

240
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:36,892
He Was supposed to realize
his own mistake.

241
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,592
No, no, don't even think

about it, sweetheart.

242
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,099
Sit back. Do nothing.

243
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,102
We've raised
the perfect teenage boy.

244
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,696
He's quite capable
of running his own life.

245
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:49,572
Alan...I'm letting you
out of your cage.

246
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,076
Thank you!

247
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,574
[Music playing]

248
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:58,106
ALAN: Eric. you are not
going to quit a steady job...

249
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,016
for one
modeLing assignment.

250
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,850
I'm sure if you really
think this through...

251
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,187
you will realize that this is
not something you really want.

252
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,624
I've thought. I want.

253
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,354
When? When did you think...

254
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,055
in the ten seconds
since you got home?

255
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,564
That is not the way you make
an important decision...

256
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,089
that will change your life.

257
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,896
You want to make
an important decision?

258
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,233
You consider
every aspect of it.

259
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:21,172
And after you have thoroughly
thought this through...

260
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:25,007
then, and only then,
because I am confident...

261
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,841
in the way
you were brought up...

262
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,746
I will support you
in what you want to do.

263
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,682
I Want to be a supermodel.

264
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,114
Doh!

265
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,056
oK.

266
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,327
Really?

267
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,334
Really?

268
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,460
Yes, really.

269
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,969
I am not the type of father...

270
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,131
who dismisses his son's
well-considered aspirations...

271
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,232
with some quickly tossed-off
parental negativity.

272
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,368
That's it?

273
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,435
Shut up!

274
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,607
You are the greatest parents
in the world!

275
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,641
Dad, you're gonna let him
just walk away like that?

276
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,653
I just did, didn't l?

277
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:10,087
Yes, he did, and you know why?

278
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:14,389
Because your father has decided
to trust his children.

279
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:17,396
Look, Dad, I know something
about being a father.

280
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,593
And I know that this plan
of yours cannot possibly work.

281
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,625
If I ran my school family
like that, I'd get an "F '."

282
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,264
Don't you see Eric's
making a huge mistake?

283
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,365
Corey, let me tell you something
about being a father.

284
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,842
Um, it doesn't matter

if you see it or I see it.

285
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,107
It only matters
that he doesn't see it.

286
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,740
Well, in that case, can I spend
the night at Shawn's?

287
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,340
It's a school night.

288
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,180
Yeah, but I don't

see that, Dad.

289
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,345
only you see that.

290
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,147
Well, do you see this?

291
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,458
You know, Dad, those aren't

very clear-cut rules.

292
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,430
Kind of a double
standard going on.

293
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,228
If you keep changing
the rules...

294
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,758
how am I gonna learn
how to be a model father?

295
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,771
Ask your wife.

296
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,078
So, this family's crisis--

297
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:10,572
the older, cooler brother

wants to get a tattoo.

298
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,083
Conflicts abound.

299
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:15,781
Take it away,
younger, uncool brother.

300
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,086
I can't fathom
why any human being...

301
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,921
in full possession
of his faculties...

302
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,223
would want to render himself
permanently disfigured...

303
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,991
with so-called "body art. "

304
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,561
Whoa.

305
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,626
What?

306
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,867
I'm such a good geek
I scared myself.

307
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:37,535
Listen, pinhead, it's my body.

308
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:40,045
And I'll do whatever
I want with it...

309
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,513
unless maybe you'd like
to try and stop me...

310
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,516
you woodchuck faced,
nearsighted...

311
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,075
underweight,
future l.R.S. auditor.

312
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,056
Mr. Minkus,

I might remind you...

313
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,058
that eventually
the bell will ring...

314
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,253
and he will be he,

and you will be you...

315
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,092
and natural selection
will once again rule...

316
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,190
the blackboard jungle.

317
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,331
Will five cover it?

318
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,600
Hey, talk some more.

319
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,075
oK, you live under our roof.

320
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,906
We make the decisions.
No tattoo.

321
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,935
Tattoo, you, no.

322
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,949
A person's body is his temple.

323
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:20,749
If our son Wants to ornament
his temple With a tattoo...

324
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,914
Iet him worship
in his own way.

325
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,082
Nam myo ho renge kyo.

326
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,251
You are so bizarre!

327
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,893
I've decided, without benefit

of discussion with my spouse--

328
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,230
because that's the kind of
husband I know you'll be--

329
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,793
the tattoo will have to wait.

330
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,040
Whoa.

331
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,598
Cool.

332
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:47,044
Stuart, a tattoo.

333
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,569
It speaks to me.

334
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,975
Minkus, what's the deal?

335
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,714
We agreed on no tattoo.

336
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:58,053
Mr. Feeny's assignment was
to solve a family problem...

337
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,320
and I decided
to solve it my way.

338
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,384
Well, actually, his way.

339
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,895
Minkus...

340
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,057
you've got a dark side.

341
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,498
It speaks to me.

342
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,628
Let's not go overboard.
It's just a press-on.

343
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,070
Great.

344
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,130
Thanks for screwing up
the assignment.

345
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,142
on the contrary, Mr. Matthews.

346
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,111
Mr. Minkus didn't screw up
the assignment at all.

347
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,205
Yeah, but we had

our family discussion...

348
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,079
all planned out,
and he messed it up.

349
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,344
He broke the rules.

350
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:29,684
Which is exactly what happens
in real families.

351
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,816
There is no model household.

352
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,123
There are no model parents.

353
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,527
I think the only way
you can judge a family...

354
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,394
is by how much love
there is in the home.

355
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:40,899
Excellent point,
Miss Lawrence.

356
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,697
A family is a living,
breathing thing...

357
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:47,103
that requires constant
adjustment and change.

358
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,970
But Beaver's dad
never changed.

359
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,999
You always knew
what he was gonna say.

360
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:55,036
Beaver's dad Wasn't real.
Real fathers have to adapt.

361
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,708
Real fathers
don't have a script...

362
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,649
Iike Beaver's father did.

363
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,515
I guess it's easy
to sound smart...

364
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,214
when you've got the best writers
in Hollywood...

365
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,745
writing everything you say.

366
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,021
I Wouldn't know.

367
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,025
Hi. I'm Eric Matthews.

368
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,962
I believe you'll be
taking pictures of me.

369
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,966
[Giggles]
Because he's a model.

370
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,560
And we're the babes
who hang out with him.

371
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:19,070
Because he's a model.

372
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,504
And who are you?

373
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,235
I'm the happy sidekick.

374
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,304
Come on, Matthews.

375
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,675
They're waiting for you
in wardrobe.

376
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,680
Wardrobe--industry term
for clothes.

377
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,614
Excuse me.

378
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,413
Look, my shoot starts at 4:00.

379
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,679
Make sure these girls are here.

380
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,586
I want them to see me
in all my glory.

381
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,988
I quit!

382
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,492
You can't quit.

383
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,754
You signed a contract.

384
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,421
Do you have any idea
what it's like...

385
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,293
to dress up
in a humiliating outfit...

386
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:48,357
and have people gawk at you
like you're less than human?

387
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,302
Been there. Done that.

388
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:54,704
Welcome to the world
of big-time modeling.

389
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,910
What are you looking at?

390
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,441
oh!

391
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,745
Cory!

392
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,619
Cory, that lobster over there
seems to know you.

393
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:13,492
Boy, what kind
of idiot would wear...

394
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,619
one of these getups
at the mall?

395
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,060
ERIC : Come here!

396
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,791
Apparently Eric.

397
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,097
Eric, this may come
as somewhat of a shock...

398
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,501
but you're a lobster, dude.

399
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,200
Look, Jason and I invited

2 girls here to watch me model.

400
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,834
Well, I hope they bring
a side of slaw.

401
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,309
[Both laugh]

402
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,279
You have to get rid of them!

403
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,505
Jason!

404
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,847
Hey, come to see your brother
up in lights, too, huh?

405
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,249
Yeah, but he had to leave.

406
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,583
Why? What happened?

407
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,452
Uh, he's not feeling well.

408
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,286
Yeah, he's a little

under the water.

409
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,451
-Weather.
-Yeah.

410
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,188
Wow, how weird.

411
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,991
He was fine a few hours ago.

412
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,964
So, I guess you want
to just take the girls...

413
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,626
and get out of here
immediately, right?

414
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,964
MAN ON P.A.:

415
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,799

oh, lobster.

419
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:05,601
Win us a lobster.

420

ALL you have to do

421

is knock Larry the Lobster
into the giant tub of butter.

422
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,112
Eric! My brother Eric!

423
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,953
That's my brother Eric!

424
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,050
oh, check it out.

425
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,618
oh, he's a lobster.

426
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,654
SECOND GIRL:
How embarrassing for him.

427
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:28,667
Maybe we should be sensitive
and understanding.

428
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,067
Then We Wouldn't be us.

429
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,367
-Dunk him.
-Dunk him.

430
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,873
Hey, come on.
Don't throw that, Jason.

431
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,137
We've been best friends
since we were three years old.

432
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,404
Who are you gonna listen to...

433
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,413
some girls you don't
even know or me?

434
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:42,436
See ya.

435
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,949
[Music playing]

436
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,593
Ahem. Welcome
to Market Giant, sir.

437
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,099
Here on aisle one...

438
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,601
you'll find our sugar,
flour, and iodized salt.

439
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:06,196
over here on aisle two,

you'll find our cereals...

440
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,865
rice, and freeze-dried coffees.

441
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,534
Do your items
need bagging, sir?

442
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,543
Here, let me help you
quickly and efficiently.

443
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,238
I know that cans
go on the bottom...

444
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,507
durable boxes on top
of that--

445
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,481
oK, oK, oK.

I get it.

446
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,813
You're the best former
box boy that ever lived.

447
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,148
Well, thanks, Dad.

You know...

448
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:21,847
it takes talent
to notice talent.

449
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,479
Are you asking
for your job back?

450
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,387
Uh, yes, but asking
is just my opening offer.

451
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:26,584
I'm prepared for begging...

452
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,956
and authorized to go
as high as groveling.

453
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,086
Eric, that position is filled.

454
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,653
You hired someone else?

455
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,464
Dad hired someone else.

456
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,728
Did you grovel?

457
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:38,100
How could you do that, Dad?

458
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:40,697
I'm the store manager.
It's kind of my job.

459
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,435
You got to give me
my job back, Dad.

460
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,272
Eric, I can't fire somebody...

461
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,210
just because you suddenly
want to come back.

462
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,770
Dad, do you remember
when I was little...

463
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,372
and we used to play
Monopoly...

464
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,008
and I'd roll the dice
and land on Boardwalk...

465
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,042
-while you had a hotel on it?
-Yeah.

466
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,749
Well, you called a misroll
and you let me roll again.

467
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,018
Yeah.

468
00:20:59,058 --> 00:20:59,717
Well, Dad,

this modeling thing...

469
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,751
I--I misrolled.

470
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:05,093
Yeah, but...

471
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,655
you're not little anymore.

472
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,496
You wanted to make
your own decisions...

473
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,729
Iive your own life.
I let you.

474
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,364
I know, but come on, Dad.

Just for old time's sake?

475
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,736
Can't I be little again?

476
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,709
Eric, I'm not always gonna be
there to give you another roll.

477
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,370
I know, but you're here now.

478
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,847
I mean, you're my father.
You're supposed to help me.

479
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:25,373
Can I have my job back, please?

480
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:28,745
No.

481
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,053
But we could use some help
on the weekend night shift.

482
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,616
My old job?

483
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,458
Goodbye, Friday
and Saturday nights.

484
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:38,690
What's the difference?

485
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,699
After those two girls
tell all the other girls...

486
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,997
about your secret life
as a lobster...

487
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,299
do you think
you'll ever date again?

488
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,396
I'll take the job.

489
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,498
ooh, you're good.

490
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,237
oh, you think so, huh?

491
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:53,575
Yeah, because when

you're a good father...

492
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,772
Iike you and me...

493
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,509
you realize
that once in a while...

494
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:59,382
kids do stupid things
like become a lobster...

495
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,851
or get a tattoo.

496
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:03,582
But a family's a living,
breathing thing.

497
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,419
And you didn't
let that throw you.

498
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,220
Did you get a tattoo?

499
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,819
-Hmm?
-What?

500
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,799
Did you get a tattoo?
Because if you got a tattoo...

501
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,803
You are not gonna be a living,
breathing thing. Where is it?

502
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,668
-You're missing the point, Dad!
-Where's the tattoo?

503
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,604
[Grunting]

504
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,512
So you teach modeling, huh?

505
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,319
Mm-hmm.

506
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,155
And you probably sell
the pictures...

507
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,218
a guy would need
for his portfolio, too?

508
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:44,456
Mm-hmm.

509
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,932
And that would run in the range
of what, ninety bucks?

510
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,798
Are you lost?

511
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,736
No. See, I saw your
modeling pictures up here...

512
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:53,965
and I was wondering...

513
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:55,473
If I'm the type of guy
you're looking for.

514
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,168
Not interested.

515
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,801
How come
you're not interested?

516
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:01,673
Do you have $90?
