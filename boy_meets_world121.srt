00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,889
Don't insult the boy
with the Perkys.

173
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:55,264
I'm sorry. All right,
so what do I have to do?

174
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,464
According to the survey
in the September issue...

175
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,405
what do you think
is the number one thing...

176
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,340
girls want from a guy?

177
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,707
Uh, loose change?

178
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,644
That's number nine.

179
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,512
The number one thing
is shared interest.

180
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,574
And that means...

181
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,812
Cory, this isn't algebra.

182
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:16,151
This is something
you can conceivably understand.

183
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,953
Shared interests. Talk to me.

184
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,927
If she's into something,
show an interest in it.

185
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,952
Example--
if the girl you're dating...

186
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,830
is interested in numismatics,

you talk about...

187
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,800
Numizmos?

188
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,735
Coins.

189
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,237
All right, give me
number two on that list...

190
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,968
just in case I can't fake
an interest in something.

191
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,805
-Sense of humor.
-No problem.

192
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,970
I'm a regular laugh riot.

193
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,310
All right, so how do l
select a lucky girl?

194
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,814
Well, just think of someone...

195
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,316
you're completely
comfortable with...

196
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,818
someone you could
share a meal with...

197
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,822
and someone who doesn't mind
having you around.

198
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,256
Well, my mom's already taken.

199
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,689
Cory, just go for
the first thing in a dress.

200
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,892
A dress. A dress.

201
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,924
A dress. A dress.

202
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,500
-Topanga.
-Yes, Cory?

203
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,804
So, what's interesting
in your life right now?

204
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,811
Well,

Mercury is in retrograde...

205
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,813
making projects
difficult to complete...

206
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:17,248
and causing general chaos
in the universe.

207
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,743
You know, not only is that
unbelievably interesting...

208
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,256
it reminds me of a joke
I once heard.

209
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,349
How did the astrologer
cross the road?

210
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,725
-I don't know.
-ln his Taurus.

211
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,631
But I kid the zodiac.

212
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,223
Um, would you like to go...

213
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,497
to Bob Stubcheck's Burger World
after school?

214
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,731
Cory, I'm a vegetarian.

215
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,238
of course you are.

216
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,968
That's why we're just going
to meet at Burger World...

217
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,476
and walk over to
lnternational House of Salads.

218
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,604
I love lHOS.

219
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,705
Who doesn't?

220
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:52,707
oK. Gee, I wonder

what the sprout of the day is.

221
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,515
Who cares?
You can't go wrong...

222
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:57,785
with a nice bowl
of spaghetti and sprout balls.

223
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,815
So, I'll just meet you at 4:30.

224
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,258
oK, it's a date.

225
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:05,060
A date?
Who said anything about a date?

226
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:07,089
What have I done?

227
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:27,651
oK. What do you know
that I don't know?

228
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,154
Nothing.

229
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,524
-Which kid is it?
-Cory.

230
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,529
oh, I knew it.

oK, oK. Let's see.

231
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:41,193
He's too old to steal candy,
but too young to wreck a car.

232
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,726
oh, no. It's a girl.

233
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,363
It is.

234
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:50,137
Cory is going on his first date.
Isn't that sweet?

235
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,906
Yeah. Poor slob.

236
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:55,471
What are you saying?

237
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,483
You're his father.
You should be proud.

238
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,314
Hey, I've been
on the guy side of dating.

239
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:02,048
I mean, he's fine now, but he's

just a little step away from...

240
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:05,489
huh-huh-huh-huh-huh.

241
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,993
Dating was always fun for me.

242
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:12,088
I remember talking on the phone
to eight different guys a night.

243
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,598
Yeah, well,

the only way I survived it...

244
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,157
was knowing
that one day I'd be married...

245
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,226
and I'd be calling the shots.

246
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,434
Honey, I'm so sorry things
didn't work out for you.

247
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,942
I Wonder if
I can still Warn him...

248
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:26,138
about the minefield
he's about to step into...

249
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,771
without ruining his life.

250
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:30,942
Well, Cory doesn't appear
to be suffering like you did.

251
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,282
He's actually excited
about this date.

252
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,287
I overheard him telling Shawn...

253
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,289
that he couldn't
play basketball today...

254
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,257
because he was going out
with Topanga.

255
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:43,820
Topanga? Cory's always teasing,
making fun of her.

256
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,496
oh, no. This is bad.

257
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,168
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

258
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,729
Cory, I think
this is so wonderful.

259
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,901
Son, this is the stupidest
thing you've ever done.

260
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,468
Before I shoot myself
in the foot...

261
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,707
which stupid thing
are we talking about?

262
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:05,616
-Your date with Topanga.
-What were you thinking?

263
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,552
Everything started
getting all fuzzy...

264
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,054
after that telegram movie.

265
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,113
Not the hormonal telegram.

266
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,057
Are they still showing
that film?

267
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,787
I cried during that movie.

268
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,762
If it wasn't for that movie,

I'd still be twelve.

269
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,822
Yeah, it had a weird effect

on a lot of people.

270
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,060
But ever since We saw it...

271
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,330
people are doing
really strange things.

272
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,099
Well, you certainly are. You've
never asked a girl out before.

273
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,835
Yeah, well, neither did Shawn.

274
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,038
Did you ask Topanga out
so you could keep up with him?

275
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,679
Whoa. That's weird.

276
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,648
How did she know?

277
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,808
It's the sorority of Satan.

278
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,816
Well, Cor, as much as

I wanted to see you...

279
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,051
go out
on your first little date...

280
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,322
I don't think
it's fair to Topanga.

281
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,055
As much as
I wanted to see it, too...

282
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:55,499
I--I think your mother's right.
You should cancel--now.

283
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:57,762
Mom, Dad, you're right.

284
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:00,329
With women,

honesty is the best policy.

285
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,933
And he thinks
he's ready to date.

286
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,419
Hi. Is Topanga there?

287
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,752
Yeah, I did mean physically.

288
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,916
Hi, Topanga.
It's me--Cory Matthews.

289
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,426
You probably remember me
from school.

290
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:25,420
Yeah. Well, listen,

when I made this date...

291
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:30,425
I didn't know it at that time,

but now I just found out.

292
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,938
Topanga, I got to be
totally honest with you.

293
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,440
[Coughs]

294
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:38,967
I got the flu,
and I can't go out.

295
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,970
I feel fine about that.

296
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:48,954
Fall-away jumper at the buzzer.
Good if it goes.

297
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,116
Three-pointer! Yes! Sixers win!
Whoo! Whoo!

298
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,683
[Knock on door]
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

299
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,059
Whoo! Whoo!

300
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,393
Whoo.

301
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,867
Hi, Cory. How are you feeling?

302
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,064
Uh, clammy. Very fluish. Yeah.

303
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,334
It's very contagious.
You better get out of here.

304
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,069
Here. Drink this.

305
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,667
It'll detoxify your aura.

306
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,979
-What is it?
-It's called bancha tea.

307
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,442
Smells like a bancha gym socks.

308
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,944
Cory, it's a remedy
that's been used for centuries.

309
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,187
"Best if used before
Lincoln's assassination."

310
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,264
I just wanted
to help you feel better.

311
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,426
I'm sorry if I bothered you.

312
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:39,268
Wait, Topanga. Thanks
for bringing the tea, but...

313
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,297
I don't need to drink it
'cause I'm not technically sick.

314
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,367
Then why did you say you were?

315
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,380
Well, I guess because
I didn't know how to tell you.

316
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,349
I'm not ready
to go out on a date yet.

317
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:55,946
That's oK. Jedidiah and Chloe
have always told me...

318
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,422
"Listen to your inner voice.

319
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,359
It'll let you know
what is true for you."

320
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:04,727
Yeah. My parents said that, too.
only they said it...

321
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:07,858
without all the planets
circling around their heads.

322
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:12,037
So I'll see you at school?

323
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,529
Yeah,

unless Feeny moves my seat.

324
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,036
Yeah.

325
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,141
Well, I guess I better be going.

326
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,548
And I guess
I'll be staying here.

327
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,420
May I ask you
a personal question?

328
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:40,929
Sure.

329
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,334
Why are there socks
all over your floor?

330
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,964
oh. I was just practicing.

331
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,707
I envy your athletic ability.

332
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,040
oh, this? It's not so hard.

333
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,103
Come on,

I'll give you some pointers.

334
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:57,138
All right.
First, you grab some ammo.

335
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,180
Ninja turtles?

336
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,689
And now they're gone.

337
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,693
Um, anyway, the key
is good color commentary.

338
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,787
If you can live up to
your own hype, you got it made.

339
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,695
Watch this.

340
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,996
Matthews sees an open lane.
He drives hard to the boards.

341
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,697
He leaps over Shaquille o'Neal,
kisses it off the glass!

342
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:21,730
It's good! He scores!

343
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,742
I could never do that.

344
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,209
Sure you can. Give it a try.

345
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,872
But I'm not familiar
with the terminology.

346
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,040
All right, I'll do the color.

347
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,879
You just worry about
getting the ball in the basket.

348
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,408
Topanga's triple-teamed
at the time line.

349
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,352
She breaks the trap,
heads to the top of the key...

350
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:39,415
and leaps toward the basket,
doing a spiraling tomahawk 360!

351
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,153
Slam dunk!

352
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,063
Look. We both made a basket.

353
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,435
Technically, yeah, but, uh...

354
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:00,274
basketball's so much more fun
when you actually move.

355
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:01,541
All right, you try
and make another basket...

356
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,741
and I'll try and block you.

357
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,091
Way to go, Topanga.

358
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,757
Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh.

359
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,259
Huh-huh-huh-huh.

360
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,503
It's nice that you help
your father with the laundry.

361
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:36,413
Yeah, well, we're

a fairly cutting-edge family...

362
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,110
so, uh, my mom does
most of the laundry.

363
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,244
I'm just helping out because
Mother's Day is coming up.

364
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,755
So you're doing chores
for your Mother's Day gift?

365
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,917
You think
I could get away with that?

366
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,826
What are you getting your mom?
I could use some ideas.

367
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,387
At our house,

we don't celebrate Mother's Day.

368
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,899
We feel it's merely
a commercial fabrication...

369
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,902
of the greeting card industry.

370
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,803
She has, however, asked

for a dust buster.

371
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,933
My mom's pretty well set
for small appliances...

372
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,909
and my funds
are sort of limited.

373
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:08,641
You don't need money. You just
need to use your right brain.

374
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:13,812
Wow. All these years
I've been using the wrong one.

375
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:16,219
So what do you think
I should get my mom?

376
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,815
You can never go wrong
with something from the heart.

377
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,587
Right or left heart?

378
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,585
You're killing me, Cory.

379
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,325
Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh.

380
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,356
Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh.

381
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,300
-Hey, guys.
-There he is--young me.

382
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,933
How was your second date?

383
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:40,810
-You had another date?
-Yeah. My last one.

384
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,805
Ah, second-date slump. I've
seen it happen a thousand times.

385
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,977
Not to me.

386
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,614
You know, you know, I'm
thinking it's deeper than that.

387
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,386
See, each one of us is born with

a certain amount of coolness.

388
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,724
A guy like Minkus could live
to be a thousand years old...

389
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,490
and never use
a drop of his cool.

390
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:02,024
Me--
I'm a thirteen-year-old burnout.

391
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:04,229
Shawn, get a grip.
You're still cool.

392
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,468
It's just the planet Mercury
in retrospect.

393
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,940
What are you babbling about?

394
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:13,342
Some astrology thing.
Topanga was explaining it to me.

395
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,779
Hey, that's right.
How was your date?

396
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:19,114
What date? I didn't have a date.
I canceled it.

397
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,880
oh, come on, Cor.

When I got home from work...

398
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,048
you and Topanga were looking
pretty cozy on the couch there.

399
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,216
That Was not a date.

400
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,088
She just came over
to bring me some aura juice.

401
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,457
And?

402
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,257
And nothing. I taught her
how to shoot a basket.

403
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:33,265
oK, so let's recap. Point "A,"
she brought refreshments.

404
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,267
Point "B,"

you chose the activity.

405
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,632
Sounds like a date to me.

406
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,263
Read my lips--
there was no date.

407
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:40,499
We talked about
what we were getting our moms...

408
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,665
for Mother's Day.

409
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,732
Aha.
Point "C," shared interests.

410
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:47,837
Sixteen to base. We have
a confirmed date. Send backup.

411
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,817
Uh, Topanga?

412
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:59,256
You and l
have to get something straight.

413
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,417
Yes, Cory?

414
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,927
Friday night when
you came over to my house...

415
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:04,793
that was not a date.

416
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,491
I'm not into labels.

417
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:07,999
Yeah, but if you were...

418
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,934
what we had Friday night
would not be labeled a date...

419
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,460
'cause if you'll recall...

420
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,063
the circumstances
of that evening...

421
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,973
I canceled What Would have been
labeled a date.

422
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,705
That's fine, Cory.
It was not a date.

423
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,675
Well, I'll see you later.

424
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:23,875
oK.

425
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,182
Hey, Topanga?

426
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,313
You know, your idea about
writing my mom a poem...

427
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,950
for Mother's Day
really worked out great.

428
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,459
She cried.

429
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,394
Tears are the thank you notes
of the soul.

430
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,294
You know a lot about women.

431
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,198
Well, I am going to grow up
to be one.

432
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:05,947
Face it. Minkus was right.

433
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,482
Don't you hate it
when that happens?

434
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:11,952
No matter how you look at it...

435
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,865
there's going to be hormones,
and there's going to be girls.

436
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,665
Important girls are going
to come into our lives...

437
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:22,333
and stay for days at a time.

438
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,841
You know what's cool?

439
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:25,173
We made it through
our first dates...

440
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,439
and we're still best friends.

441
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,002
And we're going to stay
best friends...

442
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:32,643
through second dates,
proms, engagements, marriages.

443
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,916
Second marriages.

444
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,081
Whatever comes along...

445
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,885
we're going to stand here
and face it together...

446
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,482
shoulder to shoulder.

447
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,729
-Hi, Shawn.

-Hi, Cory.

448
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,697
-Later.
