00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,700
(Gossip Girl) Gossip Girl
Here-Your One And Only Source

2
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:05,300
Into The Scandalous Lives
Of Manhattan's Elite.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,700
You're The Guy Who Gave Us Our First
Joint, Snuck Us Into Our First Club.

4
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:12,800
I'm In This Weekly Game- High
Stakes, Big Mey.. You Set Me Up.

5
00:00:12,835 --> 00:00:15,667
No One Forced His Hand. Your
Boy Lost Fair And Square.

6
00:00:15,702 --> 00:00:18,465
I Know Who Blair And Those
Girls Are, But I Know Who I Am,

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,300
And I'm Not Gonna Forget That
Just 'Cause I Hang Out With Them.

8
00:00:20,335 --> 00:00:21,967
You're Dismissed, Jenny,be good.

9
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:23,951
(Rufus) I'm Sorry I Kissed You.

10
00:00:23,986 --> 00:00:26,093
Your Mother Must Have Been?

11
00:00:26,128 --> 00:00:28,165
Yeah, She Was. Hi, Rufus.

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,600
If She's In Your Life, You're
Never Gonna Get Over Her.

13
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:33,000
You Should Deal With Your
Father. He Needs You. I Don't.

14
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:34,867
We Broke Up, Okay?

15
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:36,665
I Like
You-Only You.

16
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,800
That's Good, Because I
Feel The Same About You.

17
00:00:39,835 --> 00:00:42,265
-Do You Like Me? 
-(Chuck) Define "Like. "

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,600
Tell Me You Didn Sleep
With Chuck For Revenge.

19
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:47,400
Well, It Wasn't because 
i like his natural musk.

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,700
And Who Am I?

21
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,300
That's A Secret I'll Never Tell.

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,900
You Know You Love Me.

23
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,600
X.O.X.O., Gossip Girl.

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,600
Hey, Upper East Siders,
It's That Time Of Year Again,

25
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:09,700
When The Mere Act Of
Descending A Staircase

26
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:10,965
Means You're A Woman.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,600
That's
Right-Debutante Season.

28
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm Actually Glad I'm Going With
Prince Theodore Instead Of Nate.

29
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,650
The Further We Get From The Breakup,

30
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:26,092
The More Self-Involved I See He Was.

31
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,500
Always So Brooding, So Tortured. Ugh.

32
00:01:28,535 --> 00:01:31,100
A Girl Wants Romeo, Not Hamlet.

33
00:01:31,135 --> 00:01:32,165
Romeo Died.

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,265
Yeah, But He Died For
Something Exciting,

35
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,900
And I Want My Debutante Ball
To Be Something To Die For.

36
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,100
Hey, So, Uh, Has Blair
Mentioned Who's Escorting Her?

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,100
Why? Are You Having Remorse
Sex Fantasies About Your Ex?

38
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,000
What? No.

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,800
Don't Eff With An
Effer. I Know That Look.

40
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,065
No, Man, It's Just Every
Time I See Her Lately,

41
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,600
Something's Different. You Know,
She's Lighter. She's Happier.

42
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,465
(Sighs) She's Just-
Less-Less Blair.

43
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,950
She Does Have A Certain
Glow About Her, Doesn't She?

44
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:02,400
I Don't Understand Why
You Don't Get This, Okay?

45
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,400
A Debutante Ball Is All
A Girl Could Ask For.

46
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:08,417
It's Gorgeous And Formal
And Totally Legendary.

47
00:02:08,452 --> 00:02:11,365
Don't Forget Out Of Touch
And Totally Classist.

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,100
And If That's How You Feel,
Then Why Are You Even Going?

49
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:14,965
I'm Not Going And Neither
Is Serena, Actually.

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,500
I'm Just Going To Meet Her
Grandmother To Make A Good Impression,

51
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,200
And, Uh, Take Off Before I Put My
Foot In My Mouth, Like I Usually Do.

52
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:24,400
All I Get With Nate Is Some
Ros? In The Back Of A Town Car,

53
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,365
But With The Prince,
I Get A Security Detail

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,900
And A High-Speed Chase To
The Pierre After It's Over.

55
00:02:28,935 --> 00:02:31,400
Ooh! I Can See You On The
Cover Of "Hello!" Already.

56
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:33,700
Yeah, Well,?

57
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,665
They've Chosen Me For
"A Night Out With,"

58
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,450
And I'm Gonna Give Them The Most
Perfect Night Out Of The Year.

59
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:42,200
With My Dad In Rehab, It's Like
The Pressure's Finally Off Me.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,400
You Know, I Can See
Blair Clearly, And It's...

61
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,400
(Sighs) I Don't Know, Man.
I Think I Might Miss Her.

62
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,900
(Scoffs) You Don't Miss Her, Man.

63
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,100
Is Your Mom Mad That
You're Not Being Presented?

64
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:55,865
Well, She Doesn't Really?

65
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,100
Since I Found Out She Used To Be
My Boyfriend's Father's Biggest Fan.

66
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:02,167
Yeah. Ew! It Sounds So Gross
When You Say It Out Loud.

67
00:03:02,202 --> 00:03:04,200
Silly Me. Here I Actually
Thought You Wanted To Go.

68
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:05,965
Uh, I'm Here With You,?

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,100
Yeah, Only 'Cause Your
Grandmother's Meeting You Here.

70
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:09,400
Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,365
Oh! You're Here! I'm So Glad. Hey!

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,400
Oh! You're Here! I'm So Glad. Hey!

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,400
You're Just Gonna Love
Her. (Dan) I'm Sure I Will.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,300
Well, If You Don't Listen To Me,
You're Gonna Hear It From Her,

75
00:03:58,335 --> 00:04:01,017
And I Promise, You Don't
Want That To Happen.

76
00:04:01,052 --> 00:04:03,700
The Brands I Listed Are
The Key To Her Happiness,

77
00:04:03,735 --> 00:04:05,800
And That Includes Tanqueray.

78
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,900
Dan, Jenny, It's So Good To See You.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,765
Dan) Hi. Hi.

80
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,300
Oh, Hey, Jenny, What
Are You Even Doing Here?

81
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, She Loves These Things, Apparently.

82
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:16,265
Well, I Wish Serena Did.

83
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,965
It Would Make My Life
A Whole Lot Easier.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,300
My Grandma Was The Chairwoman
For This Event For 15 Years,

85
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:24,265
And Now The Committee's
Asked My Mom To Join.

86
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,100
And My Daughter Could Not
Wait To Go For Ten Years,

87
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:29,900
And Then Suddenly,
She's Not Even Coming.

88
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
Jenny? Jenny?

89
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,500
Why Don't You Volunteer?

90
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,600
Uh, Well, Blair's Lead Deb,
And We're Sort Of On The Outs.

91
00:04:38,635 --> 00:04:41,700
You Know, I'm Sure If She Wanted
My Help, She Would've Asked.

92
00:04:41,735 --> 00:04:43,400
Well, I'm Asking.

93
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,665
I Mean, Of Course,

94
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,300
We'd Have To Get Your
Parents' Permission First,

95
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:50,965
But, Um, We Could Use More Help.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,700
I'm Sure It'll Be Fine.
Um, See You Saturday.

97
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:55,400
Oh, Actually, It's Sunday.

98
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:58,000
Uh... Can I Call You?

99
00:04:58,035 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay.

100
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,300
Ah! There Is My
Magnificent Granddaughter.

101
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:08,600
(Gasps) Grandma. Oh! (Laughing)

102
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,700
Oh, Hello, Mother.

103
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,600
Is There A Bar In This Place?

104
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,465
(Gasps) No!

105
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,000
I Should've Known I Had
To Bring The Party Myself.

106
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,165
So This Must Be Daniel.

107
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,165
Dan, Actually. Dan Humphrey. Yeah. Hi.

108
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,365
My Granddaughter Told Me
That You Were Delighted

109
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,900
When She Decededuh, Not To
Make Her Debut This Weekend?

110
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:34,300
Yeah, Go Ahead. Tell Her What You Think.

111
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,000
Grandma Loves Honesty. It's Okay.

112
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,200
Well, Cotillions Just
Seem Antiquated To Me.

113
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:41,100
You Know, Remnant Of A Different Age.

114
00:05:41,135 --> 00:05:43,065
Well, Do Go On.

115
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,850
People Spend All This Money
To Have Their Daughters

116
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:46,600
Basically Dance In Front
Of Others For Attention.

117
00:05:46,635 --> 00:05:48,365
Uh, When, If You Ask Serena,

118
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,700
I Bet She'd Do That For You
Right Now, Free Of Charge.

119
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:52,965
The Cotillion?

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,165
That Women Should Always
Have In Their Arsenal.

121
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,100
I Think Serena's Graces Are
Pretty Spectacular As They Are.

122
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,565
Oh, Besides, Grandma,

123
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
You Haven't Used Your
Graces In A While, Rith

124
00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:03,500
Oh, You.

125
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,565
(Laughs) Oh, Isn't She Great?

126
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,100
She's... She's Great. She's Something.

127
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,000
Dan Humphrey, Was It?

128
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
Yes, Mother.

129
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,800
You Looked Pretty Hot On
Princess Theodore's Arm Today.

130
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:39,200
Oh, Is That What I Am To
You? Just An Accessory?

131
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,700
(Chuckles) Next To Him, Yes.

132
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,865
On Me, You'd Be So Much More.

133
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,850
Yes, Well, I Can't Be On You, Remember?

134
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:49,800
Because You Don't Want Nate To Find Out,

135
00:06:49,835 --> 00:06:51,400
And I Don't Want Anyone To,

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,200
But You'd Have To Learn How
To Behave Yourself First.

137
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,300
(Dorota) Miss Blair, Mr. Nate For You.

138
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,400
What Are You Doing Here, Nate?

139
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,600
Well, I, Um...

140
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,965
Look, You Know, After Rehearsal,

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,600
I Just, Uh, I Couldn't
Stop Thinking About You.

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,750
I Mean, The Ball's
Something We've Talked About

143
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:29,500
Doing Together Since We
Were, Like, 10 Years Old,

144
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,600
And I've Given You
Every Reason To Hate Me.

145
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:35,000
True. Keep Going.

146
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,400
And The Prince-
He's, Uh, You Know,

147
00:07:37,435 --> 00:07:38,900
He's A Great Dancer And All,

148
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
But Is There Any Chance
You'd Go With Me Instead,

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,300
For Old Times' Sake?

150
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,765
Nate, After What You
Pulled On My Birthday,

151
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,100
The Only Thing We Should Be
Doing Together Is Moving On.

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,800
Yeah, I Know.

153
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,400
(Chuckles) Look, I Haven't Worn
This Sweater In, Like, Forever,

154
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,400
And I, Uh, I Just Pulled It
Out Today, And I Found This.

155
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,065
It's My Pin.

156
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,900
I Sewed It There So You'd Always
Have My Heart On Your Sleeve.

157
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,400
(Chuckles) I Know.

158
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,900
Yeah, I Figured You Might Need
It Back Or Something, If...

159
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,200
No, It Was A Gift.

160
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,000
The Prince Will Understand.

161
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,800
Maybe We Should Go To
The Ball Together...

162
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
As Friends.

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,765
Absolutely.

164
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,400
But Only As Friends.

165
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:32,500
Just Friends.

166
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,000
Hey, Dad.

167
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,800
Hey, Sweetheart.

168
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,500
I Sense A Favor About To Be Asked.

169
00:08:43,535 --> 00:08:44,700
It's Just...

170
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,165
Oh.

171
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,165
Well, It Turns Out

172
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,100
I Got A Volunteer Position At A Charity.

173
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:50,600
That's Great. Mm-Hmm.

174
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:51,400
When Is It?

175
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,865
Sunday Night, And I
Know It's Mom's Opening,

176
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,800
And I Know It's Really
Important, But I Can Do Both.

177
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,165
As A Family, We Support Each Other.

178
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,565
And When One Of Us Has
Something Important,

179
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,500
We All Show Up For It. Maybe
You Can Volunteer Next Year.

180
00:09:02,535 --> 00:09:03,800
Dad. Volunteer For What?

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,200
Nothing, It Doesn't Matter
'Cause Dad Said I Can't Go.

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,600
Hey, I, Uh, Went Thrift Store Shopping,

183
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:15,065
And I Found Great Stuff.

184
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,565
I Got You Some Black Vintage Pumps.

185
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
They're Gonna Go Perfectly With The
Dress You're Gonna Wear For The Opening.

186
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,300
(Scoffs) Mom, The Kids I Go To
School With Shop At Saks And Bendel's.

187
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:28,600
I Can't Be Walking Around
In Someone's Old Shoes.

188
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,200
I Know. It's Gross.

189
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,865
Oh, That Reminds Me.

190
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,900
I Still Haven't Shown You
Pictures From My Summer Abroad.

191
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:43,965
Oh, Yes.

192
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,800
(Squeals) Be Right Back.

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,500
(Chuckles) Well, I Know You
Must Not Be Happy, Mother.

194
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:52,400
I Remember How Unhappy
You Were When I Didn't Go,

195
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,500
And I Imagine You Came All This
Way To Change Serena's Mind,

196
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:59,000
But She Is Intractable On This.

197
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,900
That's Not The Reason I Came.

198
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,700
Everything Okay?

199
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,100
Lily, My Darling, The, Uh...

200
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,500
The Doctors Think They Found Something.

201
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,600
Something?

202
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,000
What Something?

203
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,800
Something In My Lungs.

204
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,665
Oh, No. Mom.

205
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,465
Well, They're-
They're Running Tests,

206
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,800
But They Said That, Uh,
It Might Not Be Good.

207
00:10:21,835 --> 00:10:24,065
Look, I-I Didn't Want To Worry You.

208
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,000
I- I Don't Want To Be
A Burden To You. I...

209
00:10:26,035 --> 00:10:28,900
Oh, No, It's No Burden At All.

210
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,400
All I Want To Do Is To See My
Granddaughter Make Her Debut

211
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:35,900
The Way I Did,

212
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,750
The Way My Mother Did Before Me.

213
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:41,100
Oh, Mother, Anything For You.

214
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,800
What's Going On?

215
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,300
Um, Serena,

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,600
You're Going To The Debutante Ball.

217
00:10:55,635 --> 00:10:57,065
Serena Van Der Woodsen,

218
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,500
Looks Like Your
Invitation Just Arrived...

219
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:01,065
With Strings Attached.

220
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,300
Come Out, Come Out, Wherever You Are.

221
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,965
Everything All Right, Mr. Archibald?

222
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,965
Oh, Yes, Everything's Fine.
It's Just My... My Date-

223
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,300
She's Never Late, And, Uh,
She Likes To Have Finaapprpral.

224
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:13,300
Sorry! Sorry, Sorry, Sorry.

225
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,200
My Cappuccino Was Decaf,
And I Couldn't Find My Phone.

226
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:18,400
It Took Forever To Get A Cab.

227
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,900
But You Live Up The Street.

228
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,900
I Wasn't Home.

229
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,500
Well, Everything's Taken Care Of.

230
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,300
I'll Pick You Up At 5:00 In The Car.

231
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,400
I Got That Laurent-Perrier You Like.

232
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,700
(Cell Phone Chirps) I Also Thought We'd
Stop By The Modern Afterwards For Dessert,

233
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,800
'Cause That's Your Favorite.

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,900
Blair.

235
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh, Um, We Don't Have To Go
Anywhere Afterwards. It's Fine.

236
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,500
Sorry. Who's Texting You So Much?

237
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,400
Serena.

238
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,465
Uh, I Gotta Go Back To My House.

239
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,865
My Mom Was Supposed To Throw This Tea

240
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,700
For Serena's Grandmother,
And She Had To Jet To Paris

241
00:11:56,735 --> 00:11:57,865
At The Last Minute, So It's All On Me.

242
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,100
Okay, Hey, Uh, W-I'll
Stop By And Help You Out.

243
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:01,800
It's All Right.?

244
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
Who Are You, And What Did
You Do With Blair Waldorf?

245
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,000
Not Bad, Archibald.

246
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,400
I Almost Forgot How Handsome You Are.

247
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,965
Spotted- Nate
Archibald Learning

248
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,300
You Don't Know A Good
Thing Till It's Gone

249
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,400
And Found Someone Else.

250
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,900
So Your Mom Really Didn't
Mind Your Coming To, Um,

251
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:31,900
Our Ball With... Me?

252
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,365
No, Not At All.

253
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,100
(Lily) And Your Father Is Okay

254
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:36,800
With You Volunteering As Well?

255
00:12:36,835 --> 00:12:38,900
Um, Excuse Me. Jenny.

256
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,500
Alison.

257
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,800
Ah. Didn't Expect To See You... Here.

258
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,065
(Chuckles) That's Me, Unexpected.

259
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,800
Um, Mom, Can I Talk To You For A Minute?

260
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,400
Uh, No, Sweetie, We'll Have?

261
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,800
You Know What? It Is So Nice Of You

262
00:12:54,835 --> 00:12:56,865
To Let Jenny Come To Our Little Event.

263
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,350
You Know, Cotillions
Really Are Instructive.

264
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:01,800
They Teach Young Girls
Good Social Graces...

265
00:13:01,835 --> 00:13:03,500
Well, Then I'm Sure She'll Learn A Lot.

266
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm Gonna Go. Um, I'll Come With You.

267
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:09,400
No Need. I'll See You Later.

268
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,165
Thank You So Much For
Being So Understanding.

269
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,800
Oh, Come On. I Would Do
Anything For An Ill Grandparent,

270
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:29,565
And Besides, My Mom Has Her Art Opening,

271
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,565
So We're Both Doing
Things For Our Families.

272
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,765
Well, My Thing Isn't Without
Conditions, Believe Me.

273
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,300
I Had A Long Talk With My Mom,
And I Said If I'm Gonna Do This,

274
00:13:36,335 --> 00:13:38,665
Then I'm Gonna Be Myself
In Every Possible Way.

275
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,400
Well, Then Can You Promise Me Being
Yourself As They Auction You Off,

276
00:13:41,435 --> 00:13:44,100
That You Won't Go For Anything
Less Than A Million Dollars?

277
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay. Did You Get That Out Of Your
System? Yeah, I Think I'm Good.

278
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,200
Grandma. Serena, Darling,
This Is Carter Baizen,

279
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,900
Your Escort For Tomorrow Night.

280
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Do You Two Already Know Each
Other? Actually, We Used?

281
00:14:01,235 --> 00:14:02,900
Just A Couple Years Apart. (Cece) Oh.

282
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,065
Hi. I'm Carter.

283
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,565
This Is Daniel Humphrey. Dan, Actually.

284
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,200
Serena's Friend. (Serena)
No, My-My Boyfriend.

285
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Oh, Nice To Meet You,
Man. Nice To Meet You.

286
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,900
I'm Sorry. You're Not-
You're Not Escorting Her Or...

287
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:15,865
No, Well,
Actually, I'm-

288
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,800
Unavailable. Familial Obligation.

289
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,865
Yeah. There You Are.
Are You Ready For Tea?

290
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,000
I Don't Like My Ice To Get
Lonely, Dear. (Ice Cubes Rattling)

291
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:25,065
(Woman) Of Course, Ma'am.

292
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,000
Carter, It Is Such A Pleasure
To Have You Back With Us.

293
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,167
True Gentlemen Are A Rare Breed.

294
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,151
So It Is True That You're Back.

295
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:34,100
Back? Um,
Where-Where Were You?

296
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:35,265
(Kati) Oh, Where Wasn't He?

297
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,200
He Disowned His Parents And
Took Off Around The World.

298
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:38,365
Everyone?

299
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,600
Gossip Girl Even Had A Dedicated
Carter Baizen Map On "Spotted. "

300
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,565
Whoa. A Map, Huh?

301
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,500
In All Honesty, I Did Go
A Little Out Of Bounds.

302
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,900
I'm Just Grateful My Parents
Are Giving Me A Second Chance.

303
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:53,165
Carter Saw The Error
Of His Wayward Ways,

304
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,200
And He Rose Ke A Phoenix
From The Ashes, Serena.

305
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,765
Yes, I See That, Grandma.

306
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,700
I Mean, They Weren't All Errors, But...

307
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,900
Well, Your Mother Did Tell Me
That You Got Into A Bit Of A-

308
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,065
Ahem-A Scrape
In Dubai.

309
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,900
Oh, I Love Dubai. Did You
Stay At The Burj Al Arab?

310
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,900
No, I Stayed On Palm Island.

311
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,400
I Think Dubai Is Overrated.

312
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:13,565
You Know What Isn't, Though?

313
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,465
The, Uh, Prince's Crown Bombardier.

314
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,000
And I Also Went Pheasant
Hunting With The Sheikh

315
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:18,900
While I Was There.

316
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,300
I Kept The Tags.

317
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,900
I'll Return Everything Tomorrow.

318
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,200
Look...

319
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,800
I Know That My Coming
Back Has Been Rocky...

320
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,865
But I Can't Keep Being Afraid

321
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,165
That If I Act More Like Your Mother

322
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,600
And Less Like Your Friend,
That I'm Gonna Lose You.

323
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,200
If You Were Still In
Hudson, I'd Be Able To Go.

324
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:56,065
Well, I Am Not There. I Am Here,

325
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,750
And I Don't Really Care If
That Makeyou Happy Or Unhappy.

326
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:01,400
I'm Still Your Mother. You
Can Come To My Show Tomorrow,

327
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:03,200
And Then You Are Grounded For A Week.

328
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
What?!

329
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,000
Come On, Mom. That's So Unfair!

330
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,600
I Just Don't Get It. I Organized
Everything The Way She Likes It.

331
00:16:11,635 --> 00:16:15,100
I Mean, I Even Made Sure My
Bow Tie Matched Her Dress.

332
00:16:15,135 --> 00:16:17,200
Like The Book Says, She
Just Not That Into You.

333
00:16:17,235 --> 00:16:20,200
Man, I Have To Find
Out?It's Killing Me.

334
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,500
You Guys Are Still
Pretty Close, Aren't You?

335
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,000
Uh, Yeah.

336
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,900
Could You Find Out Who She's Seeing? Me?

337
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:29,500
Yes. Come On, Man. Whbetter?

338
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,900
Who Better, Indeed.

339
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,800
Do You Like It Here, Mr. Humphrey?

340
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,600
Well, It's A Little Bit
Like A Museum, A Little Cold,

341
00:16:46,635 --> 00:16:48,600
Although The Water
Pressure Is Unparalleled.

342
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:50,465
That's Not What I Meant, But Of Course,

343
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,900
You Would Make A Joke,
That Goes To My Point.

344
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,700
Excuse Me? Did I Miss Something Here?

345
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:57,700
Oh, Yes. The Way You Feel?

346
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,100
It Never Goes Away.

347
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,765
It Just Gets Worse.

348
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,965
I'm Sorry. I
Don't Quite-

349
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,065
You'll Always Use Your
Dessert Fork For Your EntrÉE.

350
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,350
You'll Always Feel Underdressed,
No Matter What You Wear,

351
00:17:09,385 --> 00:17:12,600
And At Dinner Parties, It Will
Be As If There's A Language

352
00:17:12,635 --> 00:17:15,917
That Sounds Like English,
And You Think You Speak It,

353
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:19,200
But They Don't Hear You, And
You Don't Understand Them.

354
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,300
As Time Passes, You'll Feel
That People Never See You

355
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,500
When They Look At You

356
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,965
Or Her... Charity Case,

357
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,600
Until The Day Comes When You
Realize That Girls Like Serena

358
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:37,200
Don't End Up With Dan Humphrey.

359
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,000
They End Up With The
Carters Of The World,

360
00:17:39,035 --> 00:17:41,065
And, Um, People
Like You-

361
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,300
They Turn Into Cocktail Party Anecdotes

362
00:17:44,335 --> 00:17:46,200
Of Their Foolish Youth.

363
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,000
So Why Don't You, Uh, Give It Up

364
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:54,400
And Spare Yourself The Pain, Hmm?

365
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,200
I'm Sure Serena Will Understand.

366
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,650
This Just In-We Hear
There's A Cold War Brewing

367
00:18:00,685 --> 00:18:02,992
Between Lonely Boy And
A Certain Blue Blood.

368
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:05,300
We Never Thought We'd
Say This Ourselves...

369
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,117
There You Are. What's Going On?

370
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,865
I'll Tell You What's Going On.

371
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,100
I Just Became Your Escort To The Ball.

372
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,900
But Our Money's On Brooklyn For The Win.

373
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,365
Thanks So Much For
Your Time, Miss Waldorf.

374
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,600
I Guess I'll See You And The Prince
Later Tonight. Uh, Actually, I'm Not Going

375
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:26,317
I'm Going With Nate Archibald. Ah.

376
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:27,965
Given Our History, It Was Only Right.

377
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,900
He Is The Perfect
Gentleman, The Perfect Date.

378
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:33,867
Chuck Bass. Hi. John
Mayberry. "New York Times. "

379
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:36,800
I'd Just Like To Say How
Proud I Am Of Miss Waldorf

380
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:38,765
And Her Commitment To Mr. Archibald,

381
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,900
Even Though He Ruined Her
17th Birthday And Slept With-

382
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,900
Thank You. That Was
Great, Right? Take Care.

383
00:18:44,935 --> 00:18:47,400
All Right. Have A Good One.

384
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,500
What Was That? I Should
Ask You The Same Question.

385
00:18:52,535 --> 00:18:54,517
"Perfect Gentleman"? "Perfect Date"?

386
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:56,465
That Broken Record Was A Hit Last Year.

387
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Get With The Times. He Bores Y..
You Almost Made A Fool Of Me In

388
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,750
Which Proves My Very
Point- You Can't Be Trusted.

389
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:06,600
Nate Is A Gentleman. He
Would Never Cause A Scene.

390
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:08,165
Never Get Your Blood Going Either.

391
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,100
Speaking Of Going,
That's What You Should Do.

392
00:19:10,135 --> 00:19:11,965
Carter Baizen Is On
His Way Here Right Now.

393
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,500
What? What The Hell Are You Doing
With Carter Baizen? He Left His Jacket

394
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:18,000
And I'd Rather You Be
Gone When He Got Here.

395
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,400
There's Been Enough Scenes For Today.

396
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,200
So I S It's True What They Say
About The Apple And The Tree.

397
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,400
Hello, Celia. I'd Say
It's Nice To See You,

398
00:19:37,435 --> 00:19:39,565
But I Know How You Hate Dishonesty.

399
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,400
It Appears That Your Son
Is Taking My Granddaughter

400
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:43,500
To The Ball Tonight.

401
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:45,865
He Is?

402
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,700
I'd Rather See That Not Happen.

403
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,100
There's No Point In Being
Presented If It's Improperly,

404
00:19:51,135 --> 00:19:54,700
And Your Daniel Is
Not A Proper Companion

405
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,265
For A Girl Like Serena.

406
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,700
He's A, Um, Temporary Distraction.

407
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,000
I Need Her To Focus On Heruture.

408
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
Hers Or Yours?

409
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,900
I Am Willing To Purchase All
The Paintings In This Gallery

410
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:13,965
In Exchange For You

411
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,100
Convincing Your Son
Not To Accompany Serena.

412
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,365
Before You Answer, Remember,

413
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,500
A Grown Man With Children Is
In A Very Different Position

414
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:24,500
Than A Young Man.

415
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,600
The Money Could Be Useful Now.

416
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,800
Not To Mention, How
Much This Sale Would Mean

417
00:20:29,835 --> 00:20:31,800
To Your Wife's Career As An Artist.

418
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,500
Your Money Was No Good For Me Then,

419
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,500
And It's Still No Good With Me Now.

420
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,300
And You Can Rest Assured That Like Me,

421
00:20:44,335 --> 00:20:45,700
My Son Can't Be Bought.

422
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,065
And I Can Assure You,

423
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,900
Just Like Her Mother,
My Granddaughter Can Be.

424
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,065
What Do You Mean?

425
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,965
All Those Years Ago, I Told Lily

426
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,100
To Choose Between You
And Her Inheritance.

427
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,250
I'd Tell You The End Of That Story,

428
00:21:00,285 --> 00:21:02,300
But I Think You Know It By Heart.

429
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,865
You're A Little
Overdressed For An Art Show,

430
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,150
Don't You Think? Dad, Listen.
Um, I've Been Meaning To Tell You.

431
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:20,400
I'm Sorry. Don't Worry About
Your Mom. I'll Take Care Of It.

432
00:21:20,435 --> 00:21:22,100
You Don't Mind? (Sighs)

433
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,165
I Thought I'd Be Grounded
When You Found Out,

434
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,500
Just Like Jenny Was. I Gotta
Admit, It Would Be Worth It.

435
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:29,865
I Don't Mind At All. Yeah.

436
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,865
Tux Looks Great. Shoes Look Great.

437
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,000
You Look So Great. You're
Gonna Make Me Proud.

438
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,300
Show That Celia Rhodes What
Us Humphrey Men Are Made Of.

439
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,250
What's Going On Here, Dad?
You're-You're Doing That Thing

440
00:21:41,285 --> 00:21:43,100
Again Where You're Acting
Really Weird For No Reason.

441
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,265
It's Kind Of Freaking Me Out.

442
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,300
Oh, Uh, Serena's Grandmother
Just Came To See Me.

443
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,900
Um, We Need To Talk.

444
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,900
Have You Seen Serena's
Presentation Statement?

445
00:22:01,935 --> 00:22:04,065
Wants To Take A Year Off Of School,

446
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,365
Teach English In South Asia?
This Simply Won't Suffice.

447
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Well, What Do You Want Me To Do
About It? Well, If Serena's Doing This

448
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,500
Besides, It Took Me Years
To Restore Our Family Name

449
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:15,765
After Your Exploits.

450
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,300
Trust Me, You Don't Want To Do The Same.

451
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,465
Hello?

452
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,865
Hey, Volunteer. Where Are You?

453
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,465
You Were Supposed To Be
Here A Half An Hour Ago.

454
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Oh, Um, Didn't Your Mom Tell You I'm Not
Coming Anymore? What? I Don't Understand.

455
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,765
I Thought That This
Was, Like, Your Dream.

456
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,600
Besides, Don't You Want To
See Your Brother In A Tux?

457
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:49,865
Wait. What? You Know,

458
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,865
Your Brother Dan- The
Guy Who Thinks Dancing

459
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,400
Is Making Fists And Pumping 'Em Into
The Air? Dan's Going To The Ball?

460
00:22:55,435 --> 00:22:58,300
Yeah, It-It Was Just
A Last Minute Thing.

461
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm Sure He Just Forgot To Tell You.

462
00:23:00,035 --> 00:23:02,200
Um, I'm On My Way.

463
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,200
Hey!

464
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,200
W- Wow. You Look Incredible.

465
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,200
Thank You.

466
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,200
You're Early.

467
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,565
Well, Uh, Yeah, We
Need To Talk. What's Up?

468
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,400
Is Your Grandmother Here? Where Is
She? Oh, Yeah, She's In The Other

469
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:53,700
Why? I Gotta Be Honest
About Something Here.

470
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,665
Um, I Don't Think Your Grandmother

471
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,765
Is Who You Think She Is.
What Are You Talking About?

472
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,700
I Know She's Got The Whole Free
Spirit Act Perfected... Act?

473
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:06,100
But I Don't Think She Has
Your Best Interests At Heart.

474
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,900
Where Are You Going With
This, Dan? She Came By

475
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,700
Well, She Probably Just Wanted To
See Your Mom's Art. No, She Was Trying

476
00:24:14,735 --> 00:24:18,200
So I Wouldn't Go With You
Tonight. No, She Wouldn't

477
00:24:18,235 --> 00:24:20,567
Serena, That's What
I'm Trying To Tell You.

478
00:24:20,602 --> 00:24:22,900
That Woman Is The Most
Manipulative Person

479
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:24,000
I've Ever Met.

480
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,000
She Makes Your-Your
Mother Look Like Gandhi.

481
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,200
That's My Grandmother You're
Talking About. I Love Her.

482
00:24:31,235 --> 00:24:33,617
I Know. I Know, And I'm So Sorry,

483
00:24:33,652 --> 00:24:35,965
But Maybe You Love Her So Much

484
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,400
That You Can't See What She's Doing.

485
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,500
(Sighs) I Said It. There.

486
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,100
Mae We S Suldn't Be Doing This.

487
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Maybe We Shouldn't.

488
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,000
Um... I'll Just Talk To You Later.

489
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,700
Let's Get Carter On The Phone.

490
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,900
Yeah.

491
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,665
(Nate) Carter Baizen's Dating Blair?

492
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,600
He's Got Everyone Fooled.
Blair Thinks He's Reformed.

493
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,300
He's Obviously Just Toying
With Her To Get At You.

494
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:39,565
Yeah, Well, It's Working.

495
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,400
We Just Need To Wait Until We
Can Get Him In A Public Place,

496
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,500
Where Everyone Who Thinks
He's Changed Can See The Truth,

497
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,500
And We Can Get Him Back For
Everything He's Done To You

498
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,500
And Everything He's Doing To Blair.

499
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah, When's That Gonna Happen, Huh?

500
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,500
Sir.

501
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,100
I Have A Feeling It May
Be Sooner Than You Think.

502
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,200
And One More, Ladies. If
You Don't Pull It Together,

503
00:26:17,235 --> 00:26:18,600
I'm Gonna Go Naomi
Campbell On You. (Sighs)

504
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,800
Maybe Jenny Can Help You.
No, I'm Fine. Thank You.

505
00:26:23,835 --> 00:26:25,365
Serena, Uh, Miss Erlich Needs To Know

506
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,500
How To Pronounce That Word In
Your Presentation Statement.

507
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,300
I Assume It's A Family Name.

508
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,100
Hey. Beautiful. What's Wrong? I
Didn't Write This. My Mother Did.

509
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,200
"Serena Hopes To Continue To

512
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,100
(Blair) Make It Stop. You Sound
Like Me. Serena, Where'dadan?

513
00:26:46,135 --> 00:26:47,400
(Serena) He's Not Coming.

514
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,100
Here You Go. Thanks.

515
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,300
What Is He Doing Here?

516
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,900
(Chuck) Carter's Clever.

517
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,200
He's Using Serena As A
Cover. It's Not The Time Yet.

518
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,200
Nate, Look, I Was Hoping To
See You. I Wanted To Apologize,

519
00:27:12,235 --> 00:27:13,965
Put The Past In The Past.

520
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,700
You Don't Get To Say What Goes On Here.

521
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,300
I'm On To You.

522

00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
(Guests Murmuring) (Woman) Oh, My God.

545
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,600
Sorry.

546
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,800

550
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,400
You're Back. What Happened?

551
00:29:05,435 --> 00:29:07,200
Uh, Cece Won.

552
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,265
She Has A Habit Of Doing That,

553
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,400
But Maybe It's For The Best.
You're Here With Your Family.

554
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,800
(Man) * You Don't Know
What's Right Anymore *

555
00:29:14,835 --> 00:29:17,300
Hey. Where's Jenny? Have You Seen Her?

556
00:29:17,335 --> 00:29:18,965
Actually, Uh, No.

557
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,350
She's Probably Still Upset
With Me For Grounding Her

558
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,642
And Is Trying To Teach
Me A Lesson. I Don't Know.

559
00:29:23,677 --> 00:29:25,900
Maybe Let Her Be Ten Minutes
Late Before You Get Mad?

560
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,600
Mom, This Looks Great. All Of This Is
Beautiful. Thank You. Come On. Tour.

561
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,150
Okay.

562
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:34,065
Let's Go.

563
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,600
(The Pierces) * Got A
Secret, Can You Keep It? *

564
00:29:36,635 --> 00:29:39,267
* Swear This One You'll Save *

565
00:29:39,302 --> 00:29:41,701
* Better Lock It In Your Pocket *

566
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:44,065
* Taking This One To The Grave *

567
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,000
* If I Show You, Then I
Know You Won't Tell... *

568
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:48,965
What's Going On?

569
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,200
* 'Cause Two Can Keep A Secret *

570
00:29:51,235 --> 00:29:53,665
Hmm? Nothing.

571
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,550
* Got A Secret, Can You Keep It? *

572
00:29:56,585 --> 00:29:59,365
* Swear This One You'll Save *

573
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,300
We're Friends Now,
Right? You Can Tell Me.

574
00:30:01,335 --> 00:30:03,965
* Taking This One To The Grave *

575
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
* If I Show You, Then I Know
You Won't Tell What I Said *

576
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,300
* 'Cause Two Can Keep A
Secret If One Of Them Is Dead *

577
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,100
* Got A Secret, Can You Keep It? *

578
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:20,465
* Swear This One You'll Save *

579
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,600
And Now For Someone
With Only One Left Foot.

580
00:30:22,635 --> 00:30:24,265
* Taking This One To The Grave *

581
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,600
He Just Told Her What He's
Going To Do To Her Later.

582
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,450
* You Won't Tell What I Said *

583
00:30:30,485 --> 00:30:31,942
They Might Not Know Who You Are,

584
00:30:31,977 --> 00:30:33,400
But I Sure As Hell Never Forgot.

585
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,100
Nate, What Are You Doing?
(Nate) She's My Girlfriend!

586
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,900
Oh, My God.

587
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,465
(Carter) Get Off Me!
Ugh! They Ripped My Dress.

588
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,300
Take Him Outside. Let's Get
Out Of Here. Come On. Come On.

589
00:30:44,335 --> 00:30:46,065
You Don't Understand. It Was
Custom-Made. Blair, It's Okay.

590
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,600
My Mom Is Gonna Be Angry. Jenny!
Jenny, Hey, Hey, We Need You. Please?

591
00:30:48,635 --> 00:30:50,565
I Have To Go. I Have My Mom's Thing.

592
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,000
(Blair) Jenny, Fix My
Dress, And All Is Forgiven.

593
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,465
Oh, You Make A Fool

594
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,865
Of The Presenter,
Then You Start A Brawl.

595
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,965
I Mean, What's Next,
Serena? "Girls Gone Wild"?

596
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,265
Serena Van Der Woodsen Wants
To Work For The Junior League

597
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,300
And Have Two Children? It's A Society Ball,
Serena. You Have To Represent Yourself Well.

598
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,800
How Is It Representing
Myself Well If It's All Lies?

599
00:31:13,835 --> 00:31:15,900
What Happened To You
Between Our Talk And Now?

600
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,465
I Did This Because I Knew

601
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,465
How Important It Was
For You And Grandma,

602
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,600
And You Said That If I
Did It, I Could Be Myself.

603
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,165
You Don't Really Want That, Do You?

604
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,400
No, It's Not Entirely True. All You
Care About When People Look At Me

605
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,400
Is What They Think Of You.

606
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,465
How Am I Supposed To Accept Myself

607
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,500
If My Own Mother Doesn't
Accept Me? Oh, Honey,

608
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,865
No.

609
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,700
No, You Don't, But Let
Me Tell You Something.

610
00:31:46,735 --> 00:31:49,100
If I Ever Do Have Those Two Children,

611
00:31:49,135 --> 00:31:50,900
I Would Never Do This To Them.

612
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,250
I Would Accept Them For Who They Are,

613
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:55,642
Including Who They Date, No Matter What,

614
00:31:55,677 --> 00:31:58,000
And I'd Make Sure
They Damn Well Knew It.

615
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,100
Hello?

616
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,100
Really?

617
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,000
Okay.

618
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,665
Ooh.

619
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,865
I'm So Sorry.

620
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,900
I Know This Is Not
What You Signed Up For.

621
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,200
It's Okay.

622
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,865
It Doesn't Hurt Nearly As Bad

623
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,400
As Waking Up That Morning
In Santorini And...

624
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,800
Finding You'd Jumped On A Boat.

625
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,565
Yeah, Well, Um,

626
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,600
That Night Wasn't Exactly
What I Signed Up For Either.

627
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,800
The Whole Thing Caught
Me A Bit By Surprise.

628
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,700
No, I, Um, I Get It, Which
Is Why I Was Surprised

629
00:32:52,735 --> 00:32:54,500
When Your Grandmother
Called Me Last Week.

630
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,900
Wait. Last Week?

631
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,900
I Wasn't Even Ing To
Cotillion Last Week.

632
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,100
Yeah, But Cece Said She
Thought You'd Change Your Mind.

633
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,400
What Are You Doing
Here? Shouldn't You Be...

634
00:33:14,435 --> 00:33:16,265
Anywhere But Here, Yes. Huh.

635
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,000
So Please Listen To
Me And Don't Interrupt,

636
00:33:19,035 --> 00:33:21,700
Because What I Have
To Say Is Hard For Me.

637
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,765
Okay.

638
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,465
When I Was Your Age,

639
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,200
I Would Have Been Lucky
To Find A Guy Like You,

640
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,600
And I Kind Of Did, But
When It Came Down To It,

641
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,167
I Thought My Mother Knew Who I Was

642
00:33:33,202 --> 00:33:34,700
Much Better Than I Knew Myself.

643
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,100
I'm Not Sure Exactly
Who My Daughter Was,

644
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
But I Know Who She's
Become Since She Met You.

645
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,200
She Returns Home Every
Night At A Reasonable Hour.

646
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:48,300
She Doesn't Drink. She Doesn't Do Drugs.

647
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,800
I Don't Know If You're
Responsible For That,

648
00:33:50,835 --> 00:33:52,800
But I Don't Think It's A Coincidence.

649
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,500
You Belong With My Daughter,

650
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,400
And I Think Everyone Should Know That.

651
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,000
Will You Come With Me?

652
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,100
Yes, Mrs. Van Der
Woodsen. I Would Love To.

653
00:34:04,135 --> 00:34:06,800
Good. And It's Lily.

654
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,765
Have You Seen Nate?

655
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,200
Nate Was Asked To Leave, But Here I Am.

656
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
I Know That Look.

657
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
That's Your Look When
Your Plan Falls Into Place.

658
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,900
You're Enjoying This.

659
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,800
You Knew Carter Was Going To My House.

660
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,000
You Tipped Off Gossip Girl.

661
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,900
You Ruined My Cotillion On Purpose.

662
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,450
You Did All This For Your Own Enjoyment

663
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:49,900
And Didn't Care What It Would Do To Me,

664
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,800
Which Is Exactly Why You
And I Could Never Work.

665
00:34:52,835 --> 00:34:55,200
Wait. Slow Down There,
Waldorf. You Make Me Sick.

666
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,900
This Thing Between
Us- It's Over For Good.

667
00:34:59,935 --> 00:35:01,300
Look, Blair, Wait.
I Didn't Mean To-

668
00:35:01,335 --> 00:35:02,200
Don't Talk To Me.

669
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,100
Blair!

670
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,900
That Was Quite A Mess You Made,

671
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,300
But I Was Able To Clean It Up.

672
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,900
The Chairs Agreed To Reissue
Your Presentation Statement

673
00:35:24,935 --> 00:35:26,600
In The Committee's Winter Newsletter.

674
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,900
I Stood Up For You.

675
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,500
What Are You Talking About?
With Dan-I Defended You.

676
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,100
Mm, We'll Talk About That Later.

677
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,200
No, We Don't Need To
Talk At All, Grana. A.

678
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,300
I Just Want To Know One Thing.

679
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,900
Are You Even Ill?

680
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,500
No. (Chuckles)

681
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,565
But I Could Be.

682
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,500
All Those Cigarettes And Cocktails.

683
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,600
Why Did You Do This?

684
00:35:54,635 --> 00:35:56,400
Oh, Serena.

685
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,200
There Is So Much You Don't Understand.

686
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,000
A Woman Has To Earn The
Right To Create Her Own Rules.

687
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,700
Things Aren't The Way They Were
When You Were Young, Grandma.

688
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,100
You May Be Right About That.

689
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,300
Hey. Have You Seen Blair Waldorf?

690
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,700
Up There.

691
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,100
It Was So Hot How You
Punched Carter Out.

692
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,500
I'd Never Seen You Do
Anything Like That Before.

693
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,300
Spotted- Chuck
Bass Losing Something

694
00:37:18,335 --> 00:37:20,600
No One Knew He
Had To Begin With-

695
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,500
His Heart.

696
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,100
Mom, I'm Sorry.

697
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,700
I Thought I Could Make It In Time.

698
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,400
Yeah, I Know.

699
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,200
I Accept Your Apology,

700
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,800
But It Doesn't Really Make It Okay.

701
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,800
Sweetie.

702
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,300
Honey, As You Get Older,

703
00:38:01,335 --> 00:38:03,165
Every Choice That You Make

704
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,000
Defines Who You're Gonna Turn Into,

705
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,000
So Rather Than Apologizi To Me,

706
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,265
You Need To Look At Yourself

707
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,500
And Ask If You Like The
Person You're Becoming.

708
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,100
We're Not Supposed To Talk, Remember?

709
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:34,765
Oh, I Had
To. I-

710
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,700
Your Mother Came To See Me,
And She Mentioned Something

711
00:38:37,735 --> 00:38:40,400
About Why You Left Me
All Those Years Ago.

712
00:38:40,435 --> 00:38:41,700
Oh.

713
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,200
Yes, Well, She Made Me An
Offer I Couldn't Refuse,

714
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,500
And I Wasn't Strong Enough Then.

715
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,400
Why Didn't You Tell Me?

716
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,600
Oh, Come On. You Never
Would Have Understood.

717
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:54,565
But If I Had Known

718
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,500
You Hadn't Actually
Left Me For-For Him,

719
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,467
I- I... I Mean, Maybe-
Listen, Don't. Don't.

720
00:39:00,502 --> 00:39:03,400
Don't Say It. (Chuckles)
Don't Even Think It.

721
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,300
I Can't Help Myself.

722
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,400
I Never Should Have Let You...

723
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,300
Let Me Go.

724
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,800
It's Often Said That
No Matter The Truth,

725
00:39:45,835 --> 00:39:48,165
People See What They Want To See.

726
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,765
Some People Might Take
A Step Back And Find Out

727
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,800
They Were Looking At The
Same Big Picture All Along.

728
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,665
Some People Might See

729
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,100
That Their Lies Have
Almost Caught Up To Them.

730
00:40:09,135 --> 00:40:13,100
* I Said It's Too Late To Apologize *

731
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,600
* It's Too Late *

732
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,800
* Yeah, Yeah, Yeah *

733
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,600
* I'd Take Another Chance, Take A Fall *

734
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:32,600
* Take A Shot For You *

735
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,900
* Mm, I Need You Like
A Heart Needs A Beat *

736
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,500
* But It's Nothing New *

737
00:40:40,535 --> 00:40:42,065
* Yeah, Yeah *

738
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,165
* I Loved You With A Fire Red *

739
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,200
* Now It's Turning
Blue And You Say Sorry *

740
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,900
* Like The Angel Heaven
Let Me Think Was You *

741
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,500
Some People May See
What Was There All Along.

742
00:40:58,535 --> 00:41:02,165
* It's Too Late To Apologize *

743
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,550
And Then There Are
Those Other People-

744
00:41:04,585 --> 00:41:06,865
The Ones Who Run As Far As They Can

745
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,000
So They Don't Have
To Look At Themselves.

746
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,300
Where To, Mr. Bass?

747
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,200
The Airport.

748
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,765
And As For Me?

749
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,700
I Can See Clearly Now.

750
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,000
X.O.X.O., Gossip Girl.
