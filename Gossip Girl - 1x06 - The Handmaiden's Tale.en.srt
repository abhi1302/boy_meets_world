<i>Gossip girl here...</i>

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,310
into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
(kati) you'll never believe what's on "gossip girl."

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,500
(isabel) someone saw serena
getting off a train

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,690
at grand central. I thought everything 
was good between us.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,310
It was, before i found out you had 
sex with my boyfriend. 
I didn't come back for you.

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,810
Look, blair's my best friend, 
and you're her boyfriend,

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,260
and she loves you. 
You'd really go out with 
some guy you don't know?

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,780
Well, he can't be worse than the 
guys i <i>do</i> know. 
If you want to be a part of this world, jenny,

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,670
you need to decide if all this is worth it.
(jenny) get off. Stop.

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,810
Hey! That is my little sister!

11
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:34,097
Bendel's is interested in carrying my line.

12
00:00:34,297 --> 00:00:36,462
'Cause more people 
should be like you, mother.

13
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:39,007
Eleanor waldorf is gearing up 
to take her company public,

14
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:40,227
and i've been courting her for months

15
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,037
to let me handle the deal. 
Then you should get it.

16
00:00:42,217 --> 00:00:44,447
I <i>will</i> get it, 
if you just help me out a little bit.

17
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:47,777
<i>Spotted... s. 
And lonely boy macking in the meat packing.</i>

18
00:00:47,937 --> 00:00:49,467
<i>Opposites</i> do <i>attract,</i>

19
00:00:49,657 --> 00:00:00,396

20
00:00:00,397 --> 00:00:00,438
<i>And who am i?</i>

21
00:00:00,479 --> 00:00:00,520
<i>That's a secret i'll never tell.</i>

22
00:00:00,561 --> 00:00:00,602
<i>You know you love me.</i>

23
00:00:00,643 --> 00:00:00,684

26
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:07,747
<i>long ago, when european royals 
grew bored with palace balls,</i>

27
00:01:07,907 --> 00:01:11,157
<i>they took a page from the peons 
and added some pageantry.</i>

28
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:14,177
<i>Couture and canapés are just 
another saturday night</i>

29
00:01:14,337 --> 00:01:16,057
<i>until you add a mask,</i>

30
00:01:16,237 --> 00:01:19,007
<i>but preparing for a ball 
is an event in itself,</i>

31
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:21,837
<i>which is why queens 
invented handmaidens.</i>

32
00:01:22,017 --> 00:01:23,217
So the dresses should be delivered,

33
00:01:23,377 --> 00:01:25,837
and i'll take the small stuff with me. 
Which one's yours?

34
00:01:25,997 --> 00:01:28,327
Oh, no. I'm just helping blair,

35
00:01:28,517 --> 00:01:30,417
but i mean, you know, we'll see.

36
00:01:30,597 --> 00:01:33,327
Well, here's hoping.

37
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:40,457
We'll put it on blair's tab. Oh, no, no, no.

38
00:01:40,627 --> 00:01:43,317
The girls at that party are my best customers.

39
00:01:43,477 --> 00:01:45,197
Why not show off my latest wares?

40
00:01:45,357 --> 00:01:47,287
Just return it after the ball.

41
00:01:47,447 --> 00:01:49,947
So kati mentioned something 
about a custom-made corset,

42
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:51,697
and i hear there are wigs involved?

43
00:01:51,857 --> 00:01:54,447
It's a masquerade. 
You have to conceal your identity,

44
00:01:54,627 --> 00:01:57,797
but i do have something special 
planned for nate tonight.

45
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:00,087
It's a game. It's a scavenger hunt.

46
00:02:00,277 --> 00:02:02,447
Nate starts the night with a clue, 
which leads him

47
00:02:02,617 --> 00:02:06,307
to a lady-in-waiting, who gives 
him a clue to the next lady... wait. 
Hold on. You have ladies now?

48
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:09,257
If he finds me before midnight 
when the masks come off,

49
00:02:09,427 --> 00:02:12,097
he can claim his prize. 
And what's that?

50
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:16,647
Oh. Yeah, right. Sorry.

51
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:18,687
I just figured

52
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:21,577
that after everything that's happened,

53
00:02:21,757 --> 00:02:25,027
or <i>hasn't</i> happened,

54
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:28,027
i should find some way to make it special.

55
00:02:28,197 --> 00:02:30,787
Well, that's really romantic, blair.

56
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:32,357
Really.

57
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:35,887
Look, um, if you don't want me to come tonight,

58
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:37,047
i totally understand. I could just...

59
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:40,667
what? No, i want you to come.

60
00:02:40,847 --> 00:02:43,877
In fact, i was hoping you would be one of my ladies.

61
00:02:44,057 --> 00:02:46,097
Would you give nate the last clue?

62
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:48,067
Are you sure you want me to?

63
00:02:48,237 --> 00:02:51,197
Tonight is all about starting over.

64
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:54,817
I trust you... and him.

65
00:02:56,087 --> 00:03:00,507
Well, then i will be honored to serve you, my queen.

66
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:03,757
Well, besides, you're bringing dan, right?

67
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:07,477
A ball? Haven't you heard? 
Your sister's cinderella.

68
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:10,927
And let me guess. 
Your wicked stepsister is blair waldorf.

69
00:03:11,097 --> 00:03:12,727
Blair may have asked me to do a few things,

70
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:15,717
but i'm happy to help. 
And if she happens to help you 
out with an invite and outfit?

71
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:17,937
It'll all be worth it. Everyone in disguise

72
00:03:18,117 --> 00:03:20,677
in this old ballroom... 
it's gonna be amazing. You know,

73
00:03:20,837 --> 00:03:24,717
i'm actually surprised serena 
didn't mention it. Why? We've only been out twice.

74
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:25,527
It's not like all of a sudden,

75
00:03:25,697 --> 00:03:28,927
we have to do everything together. 
All right, well i gotta go deliver this stuff.

76
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:31,897
Let me know if you need me to pick you up a tux.

77
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:37,437
What? It's a masked ball.

78
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:39,537
I'm sure she thinks i'd never 
go to something that pretentious,

79
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:43,787
which shows she knows me well. 
I know him. A masked ball?

80
00:03:43,947 --> 00:03:46,357
Dan would never want to go to 
something that pretentious,

81
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,487
where he has to wear a mask and a tux?

82
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:51,077
He likes you. He would wear a tux and a mask

83
00:03:51,257 --> 00:03:52,697
and one of my mother's dresses

84
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:54,687
if it meant that he could go out 
with you. Come on.

85
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,477
What, are you worried that 
he already has a date?

86
00:03:56,637 --> 00:04:01,737
I mean, he is dan humphrey. 
(chuckles) shut up. I don't know.

87
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:04,057
I guess a masked ball is 
better than a regular party

88
00:04:04,237 --> 00:04:06,707
because then all those kids 
from school that he hates...

89
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:10,277
he won't even recognize them. 
All right. Invite him. I insist.

90
00:04:10,457 --> 00:04:11,717
I'm not saying i wouldn't go.

91
00:04:11,897 --> 00:04:15,117
If serena asked me, i wouldn't 
deprive her of my company.

92
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,337
No, that would be too cruel.

93
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,997
But she hasn't asked me, so...

94
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:22,887
if you want to go with her, 
just make it happen.

95
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:25,587
Put yourself out there. This thing 
happens in a matter of hours.

96
00:04:25,747 --> 00:04:28,917
The window for bold gestures 
is officially closed.

97
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:30,567
(cell phone rings) is that her?

98
00:04:32,457 --> 00:04:34,157
(ring) uh, no, it's vanessa.

99
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:35,687
Vanessa? (ring)

100
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:37,577
That's been a while.

101
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:40,777
You gonna answer that? 
Of course. Why wouldn't i?

102
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:42,787
Hello? Vanessa.

103
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:44,357
Hi. Yeah, it's me.

104
00:04:44,537 --> 00:04:46,407
So what's up? What's up? 
How's vermont?

105
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:50,417
Do you still have my 
copy of "the crying of lot 49"?

106
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:52,297
Um, i don't know.

107
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:54,457
Well, could you check?

108
00:04:54,617 --> 00:04:56,777
Okay. I haven't talked to you in over a year,

109
00:04:56,957 --> 00:04:58,797
and you called to ask me about an old book?

110
00:04:58,947 --> 00:05:00,547
You know, it could be anywhere.

111
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:03,587
Try over by the window. (giggles)

112
00:05:05,507 --> 00:05:07,187
Vanessa. Surprise!

113
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:09,747
What? Oh, my god.

114
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:11,877
How are you? So good to see you. 
I can't believe you're here.

115
00:05:12,047 --> 00:05:15,077
What... what are you doing here? 
My parents said i could live with my sister

116
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:17,527
and finish high school in the city. 
So... so that means you're...

117
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:19,617
i'm back for good.

118
00:05:19,847 --> 00:05:22,447
Wow. Wow.

119
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:23,187
That is...

120
00:05:23,307 --> 00:05:24,257
awesome, i hope?

121
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,607
Yeah, t-totally. Yes, of course.

122
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:29,897
It's just... unexpected.

123
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:32,707
Unexpectedly awesome.

124
00:05:34,587 --> 00:05:38,597
Go ahead. Answer that. 
I'm starving, and i smell waffles.

125
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:41,897
(vanessa) rufus. (rufus) vanessa.

126
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:43,427
Hi. Serena, hey.

127
00:05:43,587 --> 00:05:46,057
Hey. Hi.

128
00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:50,017
(blair) go ahead. Do it.

129
00:05:50,657 --> 00:05:52,607
Uh, hey, i was just wondering,

130
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:54,637
are you, uh, are you, uh, 
doing anything tonight?

131
00:05:54,797 --> 00:05:56,887
Tonight? No. No, nothing. Why?

132
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,477
Good, because there's this thing,

133
00:05:58,657 --> 00:06:02,387
and you're probably gonna think 
it's stupid, but... try me.

134
00:06:02,817 --> 00:06:05,557
Even cold, these are so good.

135
00:06:05,727 --> 00:06:08,287
I-i've missed rufus' cooking. I have.

136
00:06:08,487 --> 00:06:11,127
(vanessa) rufus, do you have 
whipped cream? Who's that?

137
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:13,867
Uh, it's... it's my sister,

138
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:16,297
but you... you were saying something.

139
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:19,567
Hi, blair. What do you want me to 
do with this stuff? 
Oh, just leave them over there.

140
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:23,127
That's fine. I left you another list.

141
00:06:28,477 --> 00:06:31,327
Is anyone there? Hello?

142
00:06:32,177 --> 00:06:35,117
I'm sorry. Uh... what?

143
00:06:35,297 --> 00:06:38,117
Uh, you... you were asking me something.

144
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:41,177
No, uh...

145
00:06:41,337 --> 00:06:42,287
no, never mind.

146
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:45,307
Thank you. Have a good day. Okay.

147
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:47,207
Bye. (shuts phone)

148
00:06:50,157 --> 00:06:52,567
So what are we doing tonight?

149
00:06:54,107 --> 00:06:56,147
I think i need a date.

150
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,617
Damn it, anne, i told you no starch.

151
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:04,667
Howard, we've been going to the 
same cleaners for 19 years.

152
00:07:04,847 --> 00:07:07,137
Your shirts are exactly how 
they always are.

153
00:07:07,307 --> 00:07:10,237
We both know this isn't about laundry. 
I'm sorry, but i need everything

154
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:12,097
to be perfect at eleanor's party tonight.

155
00:07:12,277 --> 00:07:15,657
I can't screw up. 
Eleanor knows you're the best person

156
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:18,567
to take her company public. 
She's going to pick you.

157
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:21,227
Just show up and be yourself.

158
00:07:21,397 --> 00:07:22,407
Look, i'm gonna call you from the office.

159
00:07:22,577 --> 00:07:25,647
I gotta look over the proposal again.

160
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:28,867
Hey, mom.

161
00:07:29,037 --> 00:07:30,067
Oh, nate.

162
00:07:30,257 --> 00:07:32,107
Is everything okay with dad?

163
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:35,577
Just work stuff. Nothing for you to worry about.

164
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:37,007
Sure.

165
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,527
God! I love new york.

166
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:45,077
There was only one theater in woodbury,

167
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:47,507
and all it ever played were family movies.

168
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:49,737
"The pacifier" played for, like, a year.

169
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:53,117
And they said vin diesel 
couldn't do comedy. (laughs)

170
00:07:53,297 --> 00:07:55,197
I can't pick. Overwhelmed by choice.

171
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:56,767
Whatever you want.

172
00:07:56,937 --> 00:08:00,897
Yeah, sure, whatever. 
You do wanna do something, right?

173
00:08:01,057 --> 00:08:02,227
I mean, you don't have plans.

174
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:04,437
Big night out with overprivileged, under-parented

175
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,387
trust fund brats from your fancy school?

176
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:08,097
Yeah, the limo's actually waiting back at the loft.

177
00:08:08,277 --> 00:08:11,237
Good. We can egg it. Maybe slash the tires? (chuckles)

178
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:16,477
So is it weird, having me back?

179
00:08:17,357 --> 00:08:19,807
No. Why, uh, why... why would it be weird?

180
00:08:19,987 --> 00:08:22,927
Because we said some things the night that i left...

181
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,347
things that you immediately asked me to take back.

182
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:29,117
Because i was leaving, but... now i'm here.

183
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:31,497
Yeah, and it's been over a year, you know?

184
00:08:31,687 --> 00:08:32,977
A lot has happened, actually.

185
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:35,677
And i look forward to 
hearing about it tonight.

186
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:39,537
Late show. Angelika? 
Whatever's playing?

187
00:08:39,697 --> 00:08:42,347
Unless it's "the pacifier." 
unless it's "the pacifier." (laughs)

188
00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:44,677
All right. I'll get tickets.

189
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:46,287
Glad to be home, humphrey.

190
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:48,327
Glad to have you, abrams.

191
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:50,817
(chuck) so what 
exactly are you looking for?

192
00:08:50,987 --> 00:08:52,267
Evidence.

193
00:08:52,457 --> 00:08:53,897
Of what?

194
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:56,967
The captain's dislike of starchy shirts?

195
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,437
I totally sympathize. The collars chafe.

196
00:08:59,597 --> 00:09:02,217
Did you, uh, ask him about your 
missing college money?

197
00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:04,137
Yeah, he said he was moving accounts around.

198
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:08,917
It was all back the next day. 
So why worry? 
Mysterious financial transactions,

199
00:09:09,077 --> 00:09:13,147
warring parents. 
Welcome to the upper east side.

200
00:09:22,877 --> 00:09:25,487
"Chi chi, get the <i>llello."</i>  nathaniel, i'm shocked.

201
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,377
I thought you were strictly an herbal man.

202
00:09:27,537 --> 00:09:29,307
This isn't mine.

203
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:35,627
Who does this dan humphrey think he is?

204
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:37,457
Serena is putting up atrong front,

205
00:09:37,617 --> 00:09:38,977
but i can see how hurt she is.

206
00:09:39,157 --> 00:09:42,157
We have to help her heal her heart. 
But it's pretty late notice.

207
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:46,367
Most of the good ones are already taken. 
No more excuses. 
Serena must have the hottest date ever.

208
00:09:46,517 --> 00:09:48,017
If he's got plans, he'll change them.

209
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:49,657
If he's got a girlfriend, he'll dump her,

210
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:52,477
and if he's out of town, 
he'll charter a g5 and fly home.

211
00:09:52,647 --> 00:09:53,647
Make it happen.

212
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:56,517
(man) do you like it? 
That's outstanding. (gasps)

213
00:10:01,697 --> 00:10:03,467
Is it a bong, mother?

214
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,247
Please. I didn't take you for a stoner.

215
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:07,467
It's a... a hookah... mm-hmm.

216
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:11,807
And it is adorable. 
It's perfect for my moroccan-themed party.

217
00:10:11,957 --> 00:10:13,737
Why do you have to celebrate your bendel's deal

218
00:10:13,907 --> 00:10:16,487
by turning our penthouse into an opium den?

219
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,217
Why not? (laughs)

220
00:10:18,947 --> 00:10:20,307
<i>Hey, it's blair.</i>

221
00:10:20,477 --> 00:10:21,927
<i>I'm sorry i can't come to the phone right now,</i>

222
00:10:22,077 --> 00:10:24,067
<i>but i'm getting 
ready for the masked ball.</i>

223
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:27,737
<i>See you tonight, if you recognize me, 
which you won't.</i>  (beep)

224
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:30,847
Hey, blair. It's me. I, um...

225
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:33,347
i just... i really need to talk to you.

226
00:10:33,527 --> 00:10:36,347
It's, uh, there's this thing with my dad,

227
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:38,987
and, um...

228
00:10:39,497 --> 00:10:42,177
you know, i just... 
i really need to talk to you.

229
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:47,797
So can you call me back when you can? 
Thanks.

230
00:10:51,237 --> 00:10:53,377
(sighs) well, that's all of it. 
Thank you so much.

231
00:10:53,537 --> 00:10:55,287
I don't know what i would've done without you. 
Thank you.

232
00:10:55,457 --> 00:10:57,227
That's okay. Yeah, it was fun.

233
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:01,107
I'm glad. It's all part of your education.

234
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:04,257
And it looks like you're learning. 
It's a nice bracelet.

235
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:06,757
Vintage, right? 
The diamonds look real.

236
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:09,817
'Cause they sort of are.

237
00:11:10,177 --> 00:11:13,127
Uh, the man at the store lent it to me.

238
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,297
Why would he do that?

239
00:11:16,477 --> 00:11:18,457
Oh! Oh, sweetie, you didn't think

240
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:21,497
you were gonna be able to come tonight, right?

241
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:24,247
I thought maybe, yeah.

242
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:26,857
Jenny, freshmen don't get to go to the masked ball.

243
00:11:27,017 --> 00:11:30,577
It's just tradition. No, i know. 
It's just that there were five dresses.

244
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:33,147
Oh, it... you always need backup.

245
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,427
I mean, what... what if i spilled
something or a zipper broke?

246
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:38,887
Yeah, of course. I'll... i'll remember that.

247
00:11:40,347 --> 00:11:41,217
Have fun tonight.

248
00:11:41,407 --> 00:11:43,407
I will, and don't worry,

249
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,247
your time will come. I promise.

250
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:48,047
Now if you'll excuse me, 
i have to get ready.

251
00:11:49,697 --> 00:11:51,467
Do you think that eleanor waldorf

252
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:55,107
will find this... night in tangiers enough?

253
00:11:55,287 --> 00:11:56,507
Maybe if you brought a goat.

254
00:11:56,677 --> 00:11:59,717
You know, eleanor always goes all-out. 
Speaking of going all-out...

255
00:11:59,897 --> 00:12:02,887
yeah, i know. Tell me about it. 
I don't think the waldorf women

256
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:05,707
ever met a theme they didn't just love.

257
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:07,317
You going with dan?

258
00:12:07,497 --> 00:12:10,907
Um, no, dan has plans, actually. 
Doing what?

259
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:13,267
The question is "with whom?"

260
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:17,047
Oh, i didn't realize.

261
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,167
Well, frankly, i am relieved.

262
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:22,177
You know, at your age, you 
should be playing the field.

263
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:24,647
What about at your age? 
You got a hot date tonight?

264
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:28,857
What? No, please. 
Who would i be dating?

265
00:12:29,257 --> 00:12:31,207
(i.m. Alert dings) you know what? 
I'm gonna go try this on

266
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:33,857
and see if i can find a goat.

267
00:12:41,097 --> 00:12:42,227
Hi. Serena?

268
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:43,997
Kati farkas gave me your address.

269
00:12:46,187 --> 00:12:47,717
Yeah. Hi. Who's this?

270
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:53,297
(serena) well, he's no dan, 
but i guess he'll do.

271
00:12:53,457 --> 00:12:54,757
Hey, jen, you're not gonna believe this,

272
00:12:54,927 --> 00:12:57,027
but, uh, vanessa is back in town.

273
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:58,467
So we're going to a movie tonight, 
and i don't know

274
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:00,177
if you're going to that ball or not,

275
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:01,937
but i was wondering if you 
wanted to come with.

276
00:13:02,097 --> 00:13:07,107
So, uh, we're getting tickets online. 
Call me back.

277
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:21,937
<i>Why is it that friends of 
serena van der woodsen</i>

278
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:23,907
<i>haveo search for her suitor?</i>

279
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:26,277
<i>Have fables fallen so out of fashion</i>

280
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:29,107
<i>that the princesses have to do 
everything themselves?</i>

281
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:30,337
<i>Call us old-school,</i>

282
00:13:30,497 --> 00:13:32,097
<i>but sometimes the fairy-tale ending</i>

283
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:34,277
<i>requires the knight to get off his ass</i>

284
00:13:34,457 --> 00:13:36,147
<i>and saddle up his steed.</i>

285
00:13:42,747 --> 00:13:43,957
So... what are we doing tonight?

286
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:50,327
(dan) maybe it's never too late for a bold gesture.

287
00:13:55,387 --> 00:13:56,687
Got a mask?

288
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:05,557
Nate, hey.

289
00:14:05,717 --> 00:14:07,927
What are you doing here? I thought you were, um,

290
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:08,977
shouldn't you be getting ready?

291
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:13,567
I'm sorry to bother you. 
It's, um, do you have a minute?

292
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:14,837
Yeah, of course.

293
00:14:15,007 --> 00:14:15,507
Come in.

294
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:16,647
Thanks.

295
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:17,927
Yeah.

296
00:14:20,657 --> 00:14:24,197
Maybe it's old. You know, 
left over from the '90s or something,

297
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:26,067
from some night at limelight or the tunnel?

298
00:14:26,217 --> 00:14:27,797
Our parents did way worse stuff than we do.

299
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:31,737
It's not old, and it makes total sense.

300
00:14:33,817 --> 00:14:36,247
I think he's having some money problems.

301
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,827
Well, have you asked him about it?

302
00:14:37,997 --> 00:14:38,967
Yeah.

303
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:42,097
I just wish, you know, i wish he'd be honest with me.

304
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:42,867
It's like he and my mom...

305
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:45,477
they made some secret pact to act like robots.

306
00:14:45,657 --> 00:14:47,367
Yeah, well, i don't think that pact is so secret.

307
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:50,437
I think all of our parents signed it. 
But i'm not a little kid anymore.

308
00:14:50,577 --> 00:14:54,487
He doesn't have to shut me out.

309
00:14:57,447 --> 00:14:58,827
Look, if what you think is right,

310
00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:00,437
he's probably really scared.

311
00:15:00,597 --> 00:15:02,617
Maybe you have to tell him how 
you feel more than once

312
00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:05,127
for him to really hear you, you know?

313
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:09,047
Hey, don't give up, okay?

314
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:14,767
You should probably go.

315
00:15:14,937 --> 00:15:16,657
You know, i've gotta get ready and stuff.

316
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:18,647
Yeah, me, too. Um...

317
00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:20,597
look, thanks for just listening.

318
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:22,257
That's fine. Yeah, don't worry about it.

319
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:24,017
Chuck just wanted a bump, and blair's phone

320
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:26,977
was turned off, so it, um, really means a lot.

321
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:31,757
Yeah, anytime, nate. I'll see you tonight, okay?

322
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:35,207
All right. I'll see ya. Bye.

323
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:41,577
Hey, anybody home?

324
00:15:41,947 --> 00:15:43,437
Hey, you and dan going out?

325
00:15:43,597 --> 00:15:46,447
Just to the movies. What about you?

326
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:48,677
A humphrey man in a sports coat?

327
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:51,887
I'd normally ask if you had a date, 
but... but my wife left me, hmm?

328
00:15:52,057 --> 00:15:55,457
Yeah. What's up with alison? 
Dan says she's still upstate.

329
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:58,987
I thought that was just for the summer. 
So did her husband.

330
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,817
Okay, we'll circle back to that.

331
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:04,467
One issue at a time.
Like where are my keys?

332
00:16:04,637 --> 00:16:06,557
What do you need keys for? 
Just use dan's window.

333
00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:07,857
Where is dan, by the way?

334
00:16:08,027 --> 00:16:11,467
Uh, he should be back in a minute. Hmm.

335
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:14,207
So, uh, dan seems happy to see you.

336
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:15,527
Why wouldn't he be?

337
00:16:15,677 --> 00:16:18,877
Well, um, if you don't mind me saying so,

338
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:21,987
when you left here, 
you kind of broke his heart.

339
00:16:22,747 --> 00:16:24,817
I'm back, aren't i?

340
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:28,447
I hated being away from the city...

341
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:30,367
away from dan.

342
00:16:30,527 --> 00:16:31,837
Did you tell dan this?

343
00:16:32,477 --> 00:16:35,917
No, not yet, but i'm planning on it tonight...

344
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:38,757
before or after the movie. I'm not sure yet.

345
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:40,767
You know, i gotta pick my moment.

346
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:43,067
It's kind of a big deal.

347
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:45,927
Hmm.

348
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:48,137
Oh, thanks.

349
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,377
You know, there's, uh,

350
00:16:51,537 --> 00:16:53,537
a lot that's changed since you were here.

351
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:54,867
So dan says.

352
00:16:55,037 --> 00:16:56,557
But you guys have always been close.

353
00:16:56,717 --> 00:16:58,297
You'll figure it out.

354
00:16:58,597 --> 00:16:59,847
Wish me luck?

355
00:17:00,007 --> 00:17:01,227
Me, too.

356
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:03,517
Where are you going anyway? 
Uh, just some party.

357
00:17:03,677 --> 00:17:05,257
With a friend? (cell phone rings)

358
00:17:05,407 --> 00:17:08,937
I wouldn't exactly call her that. (ring)

359
00:17:09,107 --> 00:17:10,397
See ya.

360
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:16,057
Hello?

361
00:17:16,217 --> 00:17:18,607
Hey. Where are you? At your house.

362
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,027
Oh. Oh, you're early.

363
00:17:20,187 --> 00:17:22,117
Yeah, i just couldn't wait.

364
00:17:22,277 --> 00:17:24,747
Oh, um, i tried to get you before you left.

365
00:17:24,927 --> 00:17:26,467
I-i feel terrible.

366
00:17:26,627 --> 00:17:27,767
'Cause i'm early?

367
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:32,787
No, because, um, i... i totally spaced.

368
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:33,567
I have this, uh,

369
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:35,477
american history paper due monday.

370
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:37,557
So you know, i'll be writing all night.

371
00:17:37,747 --> 00:17:40,157
I'll make it up to you, though. I promise.

372
00:17:40,747 --> 00:17:42,457
Pierogis at veselka?

373
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:44,697
I'll call you tomorrow.

374
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:53,917
Jenny, hey.

375
00:17:54,097 --> 00:17:55,617
Hey.

376
00:17:56,637 --> 00:17:57,657
W...

377
00:17:58,047 --> 00:17:59,917
jenny, what's wrong?

378
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:15,587
And how is this a favor to me again?

379
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:18,187
Rufus, look around. 
When was the last time you had access

380
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:20,047
to the top people in music and art?

381
00:18:20,217 --> 00:18:22,617
Introduce yourself. 
Revitalize your flagging career.

382
00:18:22,777 --> 00:18:25,667
Put that sad little gallery on the cultural radar.

383
00:18:25,827 --> 00:18:27,797
Since when were you the 
patron saint of former rock stars?

384
00:18:27,957 --> 00:18:31,907
Since when were you a star? No, look, leave if you want to.

385
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,647
Really. Alison would have a fit

386
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:35,707
if she knew you were 
accompanying me to this party,

387
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:40,517
even if it was for your benefit. 
Actually, i don't care what alison thinks right now.

388
00:18:40,677 --> 00:18:43,237
Good. Then let me introduce you to our hostess.

389
00:18:43,377 --> 00:18:44,387
Eleanor.

390
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:47,377
It is divine. Squint, and it's marrakech.

391
00:18:47,857 --> 00:18:48,627
(laughs) lily.

392
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:51,777
I had no idea you were bringing a date.

393
00:18:51,937 --> 00:18:54,287
How delightful. Oh, this is rufus humphrey.

394
00:18:54,457 --> 00:18:54,498
Oh, it's not a date. Oh, pleasure.

395
00:18:54,557 --> 00:18:56,587
It's not a date. Mm-hmm.

396
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,387
Look. Appetizers. Is that couscous?

397
00:18:58,557 --> 00:19:00,307
(eleanor) yes, please.

398
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:03,747
(bart) hey. (eleanor) bart!

399
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:05,787
Hi.

400
00:19:05,957 --> 00:19:06,537
And friend.

401
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:07,497
Hi.

402
00:19:08,817 --> 00:19:11,377
Oh. Mm. Something catch your eye?

403
00:19:11,547 --> 00:19:13,687
(whispers) oh, i like her outfit. Lily.

404
00:19:14,457 --> 00:19:15,997
Bart.

405
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:16,867
Hello.

406
00:19:17,047 --> 00:19:17,817
Hi.

407
00:19:17,977 --> 00:19:20,897
I'd like you to meet carissa. Yeah, hi. Carissa.

408
00:19:21,097 --> 00:19:22,097
Hi.

409
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:25,677
Hi. Rufus. Hi, rufus.

410
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:29,977
(rufus) yeah, hi. Well, it's so good to see you.

411
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:31,067
Great to see you. Enjoy.

412
00:19:31,227 --> 00:19:34,557
You, too. Okay.

413
00:19:36,787 --> 00:19:37,637
Mm.

414
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:41,237
You and bart bass? 
Suddenly it all makes sense.

415
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:43,947
You brought me here to make him jealous. 
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

416
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:45,947
I mean, it's flattering, i guess,

417
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:49,987
but couldn't you have done a little better? 
Oh, not on such short notice.

418
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:52,877
Eleanor, oh! <i>as-salaamu alaikum.</i>

419
00:19:53,947 --> 00:19:56,667
Oh! How are you? This is fantastic.

420
00:19:56,847 --> 00:19:57,667
This is beautiful. God bless you.

421
00:19:57,837 --> 00:19:59,907
So this blair girl used you as her slave?

422
00:20:00,077 --> 00:20:03,137
No, i was her handmaiden. 
"handmaiden" is jane austen for "slave."

423
00:20:03,317 --> 00:20:05,097
She never actually said i 
would get to go to the ball,

424
00:20:05,257 --> 00:20:08,057
even if i did all those errands. Unh-unh. 
Don't make excuses for her.

425
00:20:08,217 --> 00:20:10,347
You did all that stuff. 
You deserve to go. I thought you said

426
00:20:10,517 --> 00:20:14,647
that masked balls are "totally pretentious." 
one woman's opinion.

427
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:19,167
But if you wanna go, no blair should keep you away.

428
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,787
It's not just blair. I mean, 
i don't have a gown. My friend works

429
00:20:21,947 --> 00:20:23,577
in the costume department at b.a.m.

430
00:20:23,777 --> 00:20:26,597
We can borrow one. 
Next? I don't have an invitation.

431
00:20:26,777 --> 00:20:30,157
Every ballroom has a back door. What else?

432
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:32,187
If blair saw me, she'd be furious.

433
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:35,017
Then it's a good thing 
you'll be wearing a mask.

434
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:39,817
<i>On the upper east side, appearances</i>

435
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:42,997
<i>are often deceiving. 
from friends to hair color,</i>

436
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,937
<i>there's always more 
than meets the eye.</i>

437
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,817
Is uptown this way or that way?

438
00:21:06,987 --> 00:21:07,817
It's, uh, that way,

439
00:21:07,987 --> 00:21:09,527
and these things whizzing by here... they're cars.

440
00:21:09,697 --> 00:21:11,107
You mighwant to avoid them. 
You know what?

441
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:15,617
You'll see better without this, too. 
Whoa. That is better.

442
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:18,077
Hey, you got a name?

443
00:21:18,247 --> 00:21:19,867
Jack altman.

444
00:21:28,357 --> 00:21:30,197
Hi. Jack altman. 
I just stepped out for some air.

445
00:21:30,347 --> 00:21:32,287
Altman? Okay.

446
00:21:37,577 --> 00:21:39,627
Come on. (vanessa) thank you.

447
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:44,377
Wait. Let me see.

448
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,377
Okay, look, 
i know you're completely morally opposed

449
00:21:47,547 --> 00:21:48,657
to society events and stuff, but...

450
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,287
we'll deprogram you later. This is ugly.

451
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:56,187
Just go.

452
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:58,727
All right. Thanks.

453
00:22:04,427 --> 00:22:07,147
Thank you so much. Anytime.

454
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,647
<i>(gossip girl) what was it we said 
about appearances?</i>

455
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,727
<i>Yes, they</i> can <i>be deceiving.</i>

456
00:23:19,587 --> 00:23:23,307
<i>But most of the time, 
what you see is what you get.</i>

457
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:27,167
Hey.

458
00:23:27,347 --> 00:23:28,467
Have you seen that girl i was with?

459
00:23:28,627 --> 00:23:30,587
When i grabbed her bag, 
i got her house keys, too.

460
00:23:48,757 --> 00:23:50,737
What is nate doing?

461
00:23:50,907 --> 00:23:52,387
He's supposed to go find kati and is.

462
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,887
It's getting late, and i'm losing heat. 
Well, you look ravishing.

463
00:23:55,057 --> 00:23:57,577
If i were your man, i wouldn't need clues to find you.

464
00:23:57,747 --> 00:24:00,887
Or to ravish me, i'm sure. Who is <i>that?</i>

465
00:24:01,037 --> 00:24:02,437
(blair) probably some bitch from chapin.

466
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,787
Hot bitch from chapin.

467
00:24:03,947 --> 00:24:07,227
Forget her. Go get nate. 
Point him in the right direction.

468
00:24:07,377 --> 00:24:09,027
First things first.

469
00:24:13,447 --> 00:24:14,657
Well, hello, angel.

470
00:24:14,817 --> 00:24:16,817
You must be my lucky night.

471
00:24:18,467 --> 00:24:20,597
And with taste to boot.

472
00:24:20,757 --> 00:24:22,277
Apparently not.

473
00:24:22,437 --> 00:24:23,547
I'm talking to you.

474
00:24:23,717 --> 00:24:26,047
Beautiful <i>and</i> mean? I've got chills.

475
00:24:26,217 --> 00:24:28,397
Care to dance with a poor devil?

476
00:24:31,757 --> 00:24:34,407
Why don't we just skip all that and, uh,

477
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:37,417
go somewhere quiet to talk?

478
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:40,257
I'll get the champagne.

479
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:42,327
Find me in five.

480
00:24:45,957 --> 00:24:49,007
Taking a company public is an 
enormous responsibility.

481
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:50,167
There's nothing more valuable

482
00:24:50,337 --> 00:24:51,477
than making a good first impression.

483
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:54,917
And you taught me that, eleanor. 
Captain, you know that i adore you,

484
00:24:55,087 --> 00:24:58,187
but you've never done fashion before.

485
00:24:58,347 --> 00:25:01,017
I have been talking to calvin's 
people, and i have to say,

486
00:25:01,177 --> 00:25:04,857
the presentation is very impressive. 
Enough business talk, howard. 
You're boring her.

487
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:06,757
Mm. Eleanor, i've been thinking.

488
00:25:06,927 --> 00:25:08,757
When nate and blair get engaged,

489
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:12,097
she should have my 
great-grandmother's ring,

490
00:25:14,427 --> 00:25:16,867
the one that cornelius vanderbilt gave her?

491
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:18,097
Huh.

492
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,427
You still spying on him?

493
00:25:25,577 --> 00:25:27,797
I'm not spying. I'm just...

494
00:25:28,157 --> 00:25:29,517
keeping track of his whereabouts.

495
00:25:29,677 --> 00:25:31,497
Well, so long as you're watching, he's winning.

496
00:25:31,677 --> 00:25:32,987
If you really want to make a man jealous,

497
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:36,017
there's only one thing to do. 
Rufus, i invited you here for many reasons,

498
00:25:36,177 --> 00:25:39,267
but knowledge of romance is not...

499
00:25:52,687 --> 00:25:54,457
that was, um...

500
00:25:55,577 --> 00:25:56,887
unexpected.

501
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:59,307
Give him 20 minutes.

502
00:26:00,787 --> 00:26:02,107
I need a drink. I need a drink.

503
00:26:02,787 --> 00:26:04,407
So every time we see their yacht now,

504
00:26:04,557 --> 00:26:07,387
we just pull out our air horns and let 'em rip.

505
00:26:07,547 --> 00:26:09,767
(laughs) wow. I tell you, it is almost enough

506
00:26:09,927 --> 00:26:12,487
to make you never want to summer in newport again.

507
00:26:12,657 --> 00:26:15,597
Wow, that sounds, uh, awful.

508
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:17,177
It is. It's pretty bad.

509
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,547
Yeah, yeah, um, you know what? 
If you'll excuse me,

510
00:26:19,707 --> 00:26:23,227
i, uh, i think i'm gonna go and... change partners?

511
00:26:25,937 --> 00:26:26,737
Hey.

512
00:26:26,897 --> 00:26:28,947
Dan, what are you doing here? I'm saving you.

513
00:26:29,097 --> 00:26:31,777
I don't need to be saved. 
Really? 'cause, uh, i could see your eyes rolling

514
00:26:31,927 --> 00:26:34,807
to the back of your head 
from across the room. Dan.

515
00:26:37,297 --> 00:26:38,477
Hey. Blair sent us over.

516
00:26:38,637 --> 00:26:40,177
She said it's getting late, 
and you're taking too long.

517
00:26:40,357 --> 00:26:42,387
"Your lady-in-waiting is closer than you think,

518
00:26:42,547 --> 00:26:45,787
her headdress is feathers of black and pink."

519
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:49,277
It's her. It's me.

520
00:26:49,437 --> 00:26:50,807
What? I'm sorry.

521
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:54,077
Just find serena.

522
00:26:54,247 --> 00:26:55,937
She'll lead you to blair.

523
00:26:56,107 --> 00:26:58,797
Serena. Right.

524
00:27:04,137 --> 00:27:05,827
Boo.

525
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:12,897
Let's play a game. I'd say strip poker, 
but i don't have my cards.

526
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:15,637
How about, uh, hide-and-seek?

527
00:27:15,797 --> 00:27:17,857
You hide. I'll seek.

528
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:20,587
And how will you find me? 
I don't have any bread crumbs.

529
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:25,477
Well, you can leave me a trail...

530
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:27,727
with your clothes.

531
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:33,217
I have truly died and gone to heaven.

532
00:28:02,937 --> 00:28:04,137
So how you doing?

533
00:28:04,317 --> 00:28:05,047
Serena, wait.

534
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:06,327
What are you really doing here, dan?

535
00:28:06,487 --> 00:28:08,517
What am i doing here? 
I ran across the city.

536
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:12,527
I rented a tuxedo. 
I stole this mask from some drunken kid,

537
00:28:12,687 --> 00:28:13,927
only to look like robin.

538
00:28:14,087 --> 00:28:18,427
I conned my way in here, 
all to see you. I care.

539
00:28:18,887 --> 00:28:20,197
Well, you didn't seem to care this morning,

540
00:28:20,357 --> 00:28:23,807
when you were with another 
girl and lied to me. 
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

541
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:27,567
I-i didn't... well... i did.

542
00:28:27,727 --> 00:28:29,167
Yeah. I did, but i can explain.

543
00:28:29,327 --> 00:28:32,217
Go ahead. Give it your best shot.

544
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,007
I was with my friend vanessa.

545
00:28:35,177 --> 00:28:37,847
We're very close, and she 
moved away to vermont last year,

546
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:38,987
and now she's back.

547
00:28:39,147 --> 00:28:42,257
Okay, so why'd you lie and say it was jenny?

548
00:28:42,747 --> 00:28:43,757
Because i'm an idiot.

549
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:46,717
I d... i don't know why. I...

550
00:28:46,877 --> 00:28:48,947
look, vanessa and i...

551
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:52,927
our relationship is a little complicated,

552
00:28:53,087 --> 00:28:56,477
or it was, before i met you.

553
00:28:56,627 --> 00:28:58,677
And honestly, i 
didn't want anything to get in the way

554
00:28:58,847 --> 00:29:01,477
of you inviting me to this...

555
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,467
stupid party.

556
00:29:04,637 --> 00:29:07,607
Well, i was gonna invite you.

557
00:29:07,777 --> 00:29:08,967
Really?

558
00:29:09,137 --> 00:29:12,917
So not into, uh, pompous 
ass the fourth?

559
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:16,227
You're saying you're not into 
old friend vanessa?

560
00:29:20,817 --> 00:29:23,897
That is exactly what i'm saying.

561
00:29:24,867 --> 00:29:25,747
<i>(gossip girl) oh, yes,</i>

562
00:29:25,927 --> 00:29:28,207
<i>the other part we love 
about a masquerade?</i>

563
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,507
<i>When the mask finally comes off</i>

564
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:33,857
<i>and the truth is revealed to all.</i>

565
00:29:45,197 --> 00:29:45,597
Will you excuse me?

566
00:29:45,638 --> 00:29:48,097
I just saw the last person i 
ever expected to see.

567
00:29:48,138 --> 00:29:49,397
Yeah. How can i say no to that?

568
00:29:49,438 --> 00:29:50,797
I'm sorry.

569
00:29:52,697 --> 00:29:55,097
Vanessa. Vanessa. Hey.

570
00:29:55,138 --> 00:29:57,697
This is a surprise.

571
00:29:57,738 --> 00:29:59,797
Funny. I could say the same thing.

572
00:29:59,838 --> 00:30:02,697
What... what are you doing here? 
I'm writing an american history paper.

573
00:30:02,738 --> 00:30:04,197
Wait. That was supposed to be you.

574
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:08,397
When did we start lying to each other? 
I-i merely refrained from sharing the truth,

575
00:30:08,438 --> 00:30:10,197
which would have sounded a lot more like a lie

576
00:30:10,238 --> 00:30:11,597
than what i told you. Humphrey.

577
00:30:11,638 --> 00:30:14,097
I'm... i didn't understand that either, i admit,

578
00:30:14,138 --> 00:30:17,397
but what was i going to say? 
That i was renting a tuxedo

579
00:30:17,438 --> 00:30:20,497
to attend a masked ball without 
a mask or an invitation

580
00:30:20,538 --> 00:30:23,397
to go get a girl who not only 
has a mask and an invitation,

581
00:30:23,438 --> 00:30:26,597
but another date? 
At least it's honest.

582
00:30:26,638 --> 00:30:30,397
You... you hate this world. 
So do you, or so i thought.

583
00:30:30,438 --> 00:30:31,697
All right, what's going on exactly?

584
00:30:31,738 --> 00:30:34,997
Did you follow me here to 
prove that i was lying?

585
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:37,197
Yes, dan, that's why i'm here.

586
00:30:37,238 --> 00:30:40,097
I stalked you because i am 
just so obsessed with you.

587
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:40,897
Wait. Don't stop there.

588
00:30:40,938 --> 00:30:42,597
You're the whole reason i 
came back to new york,

589
00:30:42,638 --> 00:30:45,797
'cause i just couldn't stop thinking 
about you. All right, i get the point. 
You can lay off the sarcasm...

590
00:30:45,838 --> 00:30:50,397
how about i lay off the whole evening? 
Bye. Wait, wait, wait, stop.

591
00:30:50,438 --> 00:30:53,097
Hold on. Listen. I'm... i'm sorry.

592
00:30:53,197 --> 00:30:56,797
I'm sorry that i lied about writing a
 term paper. You said you love me.

593
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:05,397
<i>Loved</i> you...

594
00:31:05,438 --> 00:31:09,797
in the past and in a preshaving,
16-year-old kind of way.

595
00:31:09,838 --> 00:31:12,197
You know, i mean, 
things have changed.

596
00:31:14,697 --> 00:31:16,197
(voice breaks) clearly.

597
00:31:16,238 --> 00:31:18,497
Looks like someone's traded up.

598
00:31:21,097 --> 00:31:22,397
So that's, um...

599
00:31:22,438 --> 00:31:24,397
vanessa, yeah. She's...

600
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:27,397
beautiful.

601
00:31:27,597 --> 00:31:29,997
I-i-i have to go after her. I'm sorry.

602
00:31:36,297 --> 00:31:37,897
Feel free to find me.

603
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:39,397
I found your pants.

604
00:31:39,438 --> 00:31:40,397
Well, you're getting warmer,

605
00:31:40,438 --> 00:31:43,697
which is an achievement considering 
you're already hot.

606
00:31:43,897 --> 00:31:46,597
Well, you better hope it doesn't get cold.

607
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:49,197
What is that supposed to mean?

608
00:31:52,897 --> 00:31:53,897
What the hell?!

609
00:31:53,938 --> 00:31:57,897
Hey, my phone is in my pants, 
and i'm stuck up here, bitch!

610
00:31:59,597 --> 00:32:00,997
(dan) vanessa!

611
00:32:01,097 --> 00:32:02,697
Vanessa, wait, please.

612
00:32:02,738 --> 00:32:04,897
Why won't you wait? 
Come here... oh.

613
00:32:04,938 --> 00:32:08,197
Because you're not vanessa. 
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

614
00:32:08,238 --> 00:32:09,997
Case of mistaken identity.

615
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:13,397
Ironically, not involving masks.

616
00:32:24,097 --> 00:32:25,497
Lily.

617
00:32:25,797 --> 00:32:27,097
There you are.

618
00:32:29,597 --> 00:32:32,297
Oh, i just needed a moment.

619
00:32:32,338 --> 00:32:34,597
That... what just happened... the kiss?

620
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:36,597
Yeah, it made me feel a little... nostalgic?

621
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:40,197
Nauseous. Right, um, ouch.

622
00:32:40,238 --> 00:32:43,397
No, i'm... i'm kidding, kind of.

623
00:32:43,438 --> 00:32:44,797
I'm sorry, rufus.

624
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:48,997
I-i... maybe i shouldn't have 
asked you here.

625
00:32:50,697 --> 00:32:53,897
Right, um, and, um,

626
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,097
i'm sorry i kissed you, but i did it because

627
00:32:56,138 --> 00:32:58,697
that mercenary in the starched white shirt...

628
00:32:58,738 --> 00:33:01,297
he doesn't appreciate 
everything you have

629
00:33:01,338 --> 00:33:03,797
over an attractive 
25-year-old mannequin.

630
00:33:03,838 --> 00:33:06,297
'Cause beauty fades,

631
00:33:06,697 --> 00:33:09,697
though yours has done a 
remarkable job of holding on,

632
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,597
and in the long run, 
it's gonna be his loss.

633
00:33:13,497 --> 00:33:16,897
And i thought he should know 
how it feels to lose you.

634
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,797
'Cause trust me, it's not fun.

635
00:33:33,397 --> 00:33:35,197
I think it worked.

636
00:33:35,238 --> 00:33:37,897
Lily, may i speak with you for a moment?

637
00:33:38,097 --> 00:33:39,697
If you'll excuse us.

638
00:33:45,497 --> 00:33:47,597
Happy to help.

639
00:33:48,597 --> 00:33:50,697
(whispers) she means nothing.

640
00:34:26,897 --> 00:34:29,297
Jenny? Hey.

641
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:30,997
Serena.

642
00:34:31,197 --> 00:34:33,997
Um, look, you didn't see me here, okay?

643
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,397
Yeah, don't worry about it. 
Just one in a series of things

644
00:34:36,438 --> 00:34:40,197
i'll pretend didn't happen tonight. 
Is everything okay?

645
00:34:40,238 --> 00:34:43,597
I'm not sure. 
Dan surprised me by showing up here.

646
00:34:43,638 --> 00:34:46,797
Well, go, dan! 
Yeah, except then he threw me for a loop

647
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:48,997
by chasing after some girl named vanessa.

648
00:34:49,038 --> 00:34:52,597
No,v.'s dan's best friend. 
Yeah, well, they seemed like 
a little more than that.

649
00:34:55,497 --> 00:34:58,597
They've kind of got a history, don't they?

650
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:01,397
Sure.

651
00:35:01,997 --> 00:35:05,297
But, i mean, dan's never liked a girl like he likes you.

652
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:07,997
Really. I mean, come on. 
He's at a masked ball,

653
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:11,197
and i think he'd go basically 
anywhere with you...

654
00:35:11,897 --> 00:35:13,097
except for maybe the ice capades

655
00:35:13,138 --> 00:35:15,397
'cause that really freaked him 
out when he was 5.

656
00:35:18,997 --> 00:35:20,497
You know what? I...

657
00:35:21,097 --> 00:35:23,497
i think i'll go and try to find him.

658
00:35:23,797 --> 00:35:25,297
I don't know how i'm 
gonna find anyone.

659
00:35:25,338 --> 00:35:28,697
This stupid mask keeps 
falling over my eyes.

660
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:31,497
Well, i'd give you mine, 
but masks come off at midnight,

661
00:35:31,538 --> 00:35:34,097
and i kind of need my disguise 
to get out of here.

662
00:35:34,297 --> 00:35:35,897
You know what? You wanna trade?

663
00:35:36,597 --> 00:35:37,797
Sure.

664
00:35:37,897 --> 00:35:39,297
Thanks.

665
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:41,797
And here, take this. It's so hot in here,

666
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:43,897
and you'll probably be cold outside.

667
00:35:44,097 --> 00:35:45,197
Here you go.

668
00:35:46,597 --> 00:35:48,197
Did you have fun tonight?

669
00:35:48,697 --> 00:35:50,597
It was everything i hoped.

670
00:35:51,097 --> 00:35:52,297
Good.

671
00:35:53,797 --> 00:35:56,297
Okay, let's see. Here.

672
00:35:56,338 --> 00:35:58,097
Oh, thanks. Pretty.

673
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:05,097
Serena, just don't say anything 
and let me explain.

674
00:36:05,138 --> 00:36:06,397
(under breath) oh, my god.

675
00:36:07,397 --> 00:36:09,697
I've been trying to do the right thing, 
but it's killing me.

676
00:36:09,738 --> 00:36:11,397
Look, i know we both care about blair, 
but maybe

677
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:13,397
the best thing is for me to just 
tell her the truth.

678
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:17,197
I'm not over you, and i thought 
i could fight it, but i can't.

679
00:36:19,197 --> 00:36:21,597
And if you don't stop me, i'm gonna kiss you.

680
00:36:22,697 --> 00:36:24,297
Oh!

681
00:36:26,697 --> 00:36:27,997
Nate?

682
00:36:28,597 --> 00:36:29,697
Wh...

683
00:36:29,738 --> 00:36:30,997
nate, what are you doing? 
It's almost midnight.

684
00:36:31,038 --> 00:36:33,297
You have to find blair. 
Look, okay, whatever.

685
00:36:33,338 --> 00:36:35,197
Just forget the clue. 
She's wearing big, tall boots

686
00:36:35,238 --> 00:36:38,097
and a big old crown. 
Just go, okay? Hurry.

687
00:36:43,197 --> 00:36:45,797
Serena, have you seen nate? Hey!

688
00:36:52,697 --> 00:36:56,597
(all) five, four, three, two, one!

689
00:36:56,638 --> 00:36:57,197
Jenny.

690
00:36:57,238 --> 00:36:59,497
It's midnight! Masks off!

691
00:37:06,497 --> 00:37:07,697
Serena.

692
00:37:07,738 --> 00:37:10,097
Serena! Sere... serena, wait.

693
00:37:10,138 --> 00:37:12,197
I'm so sorry. Serena!

694
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:25,397
Little jenny humphrey 
manages to get my pants off

695
00:37:25,438 --> 00:37:26,797
and have me not enjoy it.

696
00:37:26,838 --> 00:37:29,097
Quite the accomplishment.

697
00:37:30,197 --> 00:37:31,597
Good thing someone else at the party

698
00:37:31,638 --> 00:37:32,697
was as lecherous as you,

699
00:37:32,738 --> 00:37:35,497
or you'd still be up 
on that roof, and, no,

700
00:37:35,538 --> 00:37:38,697
i don't want to know what 
you had to do to get that tux.

701
00:37:38,897 --> 00:37:40,397
This is me.

702
00:37:40,697 --> 00:37:42,697
All right, chuck, i'll see you in the a.m.

703
00:37:43,497 --> 00:37:45,897
Unh-unh. No, you didn't find me by midnight.

704
00:37:45,938 --> 00:37:47,997
No happily ever after for you.

705
00:37:48,597 --> 00:37:50,797
Blair, i'm... i'm sorry.

706
00:37:51,597 --> 00:37:53,897
(sighs) all i wanted was for us to start over,

707
00:37:55,497 --> 00:37:57,197
and you didn't even try.

708
00:38:13,397 --> 00:38:16,197
(chuck) well, at least 
somebody's having a good night.

709
00:38:22,797 --> 00:38:23,297
(cell phone rings) hello?

710
00:38:23,338 --> 00:38:26,097
Serena, hey. 
What... will you please just talk to me?

711
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:28,197
Please. Why did you run away from me?

712
00:38:28,238 --> 00:38:29,197
Wait. What are you talking about?

713
00:38:29,238 --> 00:38:31,897
You're the one that ran away. I don't think so.

714
00:38:31,938 --> 00:38:34,397
Blonde hair, yellow dress, black furry thing?

715
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:36,897
There is only one serena van der woodsen.

716
00:38:36,938 --> 00:38:38,797
Yeah, no, not tonight.

717
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:44,197
Let me say...

718
00:38:44,797 --> 00:38:46,397
for the record...

719
00:38:47,097 --> 00:38:48,497
i like you.

720
00:38:49,097 --> 00:38:50,797
Only you.

721
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:56,497
Well, that's good, because i 
feel the same about you.

722
00:38:56,897 --> 00:38:58,397
I'm glad that's cleared up.

723
00:39:05,397 --> 00:39:06,697
Hey, um, you know,

724
00:39:06,738 --> 00:39:08,797
i hear the ice capades are coming to town.

725
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:12,097
Mm. If you're there, so am i.

726
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:26,597
Hey.

727
00:39:27,797 --> 00:39:29,297
You guys are up late.

728
00:39:29,897 --> 00:39:31,297
We were celebrating.

729
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:33,997
Eleanor waldorf has agreed to 
let your father's firm

730
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,997
take her company public.

731
00:39:36,797 --> 00:39:38,497
Congrats. That's great news.

732
00:39:38,538 --> 00:39:41,197
It is, which is why i was looking 
for a wine opener

733
00:39:41,238 --> 00:39:43,697
so i could surprise your father with 
a bottle of margaux,

734
00:39:43,738 --> 00:39:46,897
which is how i found this.

735
00:39:52,497 --> 00:39:56,197
Well, what do you have to say 
for yourself, nate?

736
00:39:56,597 --> 00:39:57,197
What?

737
00:39:57,238 --> 00:40:00,697
Well, it isn't mine, and it isn't your father's,

738
00:40:00,738 --> 00:40:03,397
so that only leaves one other 
person in this house.

739
00:40:09,497 --> 00:40:11,197
Hey, you're still up.

740
00:40:11,238 --> 00:40:13,997
Yeah, not that tired. 
Well, i am. I'm exhausted.

741
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:16,197
I ended up going to that ball, actually.

742
00:40:16,238 --> 00:40:17,297
Oh, really?

743
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:18,497
Yeah.

744
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:20,897
Well, your night's not over.

745
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:23,497
There's someone here to see you.

746
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:34,597
Pierogis? I come in peace.

747
00:40:34,638 --> 00:40:38,197
Great. 'cause i'm starving.

748
00:40:46,797 --> 00:40:47,197
(sighs deeply) look...

749
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:50,797
save it, humphrey. 
You've never done contrite well.

750
00:40:51,097 --> 00:40:53,197
Besides, i'm the 
one who should apologize.

751
00:40:53,238 --> 00:40:55,897
No, really, i am. 
I should have told you about serena.

752
00:40:55,938 --> 00:40:58,897
And i should have asked you. 
Well, i shouldn't have lied about tonight.

753
00:40:58,938 --> 00:41:01,197
And i shouldn't have run out on you.

754
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:04,997
Look, if we're gonna be friends again,

755
00:41:05,197 --> 00:41:07,297
we're gonna have to figure this stuff out.

756
00:41:08,697 --> 00:41:10,097
You're right,

757
00:41:10,197 --> 00:41:11,797
and i've missed having a friend.

758
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:13,597
I've missed being one.

759
00:41:13,997 --> 00:41:16,197
We can start slow, with the basics.

760
00:41:16,238 --> 00:41:19,097
Like, uh, fewer lies, more ukrainian food.

761
00:41:19,138 --> 00:41:20,197
And you telling me

762
00:41:20,238 --> 00:41:22,297
about everything i missed while i was gone,

763
00:41:22,497 --> 00:41:24,497
such as serena.

764
00:41:28,497 --> 00:41:31,697
Well, she's pretty fantastic,

765
00:41:31,738 --> 00:41:33,397
almost as good as this pierogi.

766
00:41:33,438 --> 00:41:35,597
Yeah, she's got this crazy 
mother who's always, like,

767
00:41:35,638 --> 00:41:38,997
sparring with me, and this... 
and this best friend

768
00:41:39,307 --> 00:41:41,097
who's very hard for me to deal with.

769
00:41:41,497 --> 00:41:44,197
The best friend has a boyfriend 
who's hard for me to deal with.

770
00:41:44,238 --> 00:41:47,097
It's... it's all very hard for me. 
It's very hard for me.

771
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:57,097
