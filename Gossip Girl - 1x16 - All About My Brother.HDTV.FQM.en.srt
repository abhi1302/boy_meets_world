1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,300
What's the one thing
that no one in our group has--

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,253
I mean, not even blair?
A boyfriend.
I met this really nice guy,

3
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:14,753
And i'm supposed to meet him
in the park for lunch tomorrow.
You're not old enough to date.

4
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:17,191
Name's asher,
and i do go to unity.

5
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:19,206
(Lily) he's been staying
at the ostroff center.

6
00:00:19,206 --> 00:00:21,940
It's depression? Is it bad?

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,300
Bad enough
to try to kill himself.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,112
Oh, my god. Georgina.
What are you doing here?

9
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,925
Well, i told you i was coming.
Didn't you get my gifts?

10
00:00:28,925 --> 00:00:31,863
What's georgina got on you?
Dan i understand.

11
00:00:31,863 --> 00:00:34,612
<i>What's so bad
you can't even tell me?
So... tell me about dan.</i>

12
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:36,987
Dan of all people
cannot know georgie.

13
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:39,675
Um, i'm sarah.
Nice to meet you, sarah.

16
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:46,863
<i>That's a secret
i'll never tell.</i>

17
00:00:47,953 --> 00:00:49,237

00:00:49,237 --> 00:00:53,284

<i>At the blarney stone
on a monday night.</i>

23
00:01:09,315 --> 00:01:10,188
<i>It looks like the battle</i>

24
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:12,704
<i>Between the queen b.
And little j.</i>

25
00:01:12,737 --> 00:01:15,425
<i>Has moved from the streets
to the blogs.</i>

26
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:17,409
<i>Who's sending
this debasing dish?</i>

27
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:19,738
<i>I have a feeling...</i>

28
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:24,253
A nice, shiny dime
to add to your collection.

29
00:01:24,904 --> 00:01:27,637
Why the fruit cup, b.?
Lost your taste for yogurt?

30
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:32,937
So what are we doing tonight?

31
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:34,605
Asher's parents
are in cannes,

32
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,837
So he and jenny are
throwing a party at his house.

33
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:39,338
It's a really small get-Together
with just our closest friends.

34
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:41,113
Sorry, blair.

35
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:43,871
Blair can take my place.
Invitations
are nontransferable.

36
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,737
She's new to the group.

37
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,425
Just because your name's
on the invite

38
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:49,238
Doesn't make you a hostess.

39
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,171
Oh! Then why is
the party planner calling me?

40
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:54,670
Excuse me, girls.

41
00:01:57,605 --> 00:01:58,704
Hey, dad?

42
00:01:58,737 --> 00:02:00,204
I'm kinda busy. What's up?

43
00:02:00,238 --> 00:02:02,863
I was just wondering
what time you want me to serve

44
00:02:02,863 --> 00:02:05,304
Your favorite home-Cooked meal
tonight. Maybe around 8:00?

45
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:07,304
Oh, um,
i have that choir thing.

46
00:02:07,338 --> 00:02:08,363
Remember,
i talked to you about it,

47
00:02:08,363 --> 00:02:10,956
And you said i could go
'cause i've been good?
Oh, right.

48
00:02:10,956 --> 00:02:14,190
Well, maybe we could wait to eat
till after you got home then.

49
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,363
You're gonna be hungry
after all that singing.
Yeah, well, i mean,

50
00:02:16,363 --> 00:02:18,988
They have food there, and it's
probably gonna go pretty late.

51
00:02:18,988 --> 00:02:21,550
So, um... tomorrow?
Okay, love you.

52
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:25,300
Love you, too.

53
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:28,238
Sorry. Floral emergency.

54
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:29,816
Oh, and you will be happy
to know

55
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,487
That the entire unity
lacrosse team r.S.V.P.'D!

56
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:38,004
Hi!
(Girl) oh, my god. It's asher.

57
00:02:38,037 --> 00:02:39,237
Let's go say hi.

58
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:42,456
How did little jenny humphrey
become the next brooke astor?

59
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:45,204
The same way they all do.
Marry up.

60
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:52,171
Hey, why the long face?

61
00:02:52,204 --> 00:02:53,363
Are you still sad
mom wouldn't let you go

62
00:02:53,363 --> 00:02:55,800
To monte carlo
for the bachelor party?
No, i'm fine.

63
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,300
I figured i'd let bart,
chuck and prince albert

64
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,253
Have their fun... oh, that
didn't come out like i meant it.

65
00:03:03,271 --> 00:03:06,238
Um... gossip girl. Looks like
jenny's been spotted at gap

66
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:10,363
Sewing stella mccartney labels
into pocket ts.
These rumors
are getting to be ridiculous.

67
00:03:10,363 --> 00:03:13,438
<i>Oh, like the one
where i'm gossip girl.
Hey, it made sense
at the time.</i>

68
00:03:13,471 --> 00:03:15,438
It never made any sense.

69
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:17,050
(Laughs) yeah, it did!
It did! Yeah, it did.
No, it didn't.

70
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,738
Wait, hold on. It's chuck.
I have something to do
before school starts,

71
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:22,129
But tell him i say hi.
Okay. Don't forget
about dinner tonight.

72
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:24,050
<i>Yeah.
Salut, chuck.</i>

73
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,863
Yes, i'm still fine.

74
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:27,816
I haven't heard from georgina
in two weeks.

75
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:29,175
So if you'd stop calling me,

76
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,846
I'd finally be rid
of all of my monsters. Bye.

77
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,612
You can read about it
all day long,

78
00:03:36,612 --> 00:03:39,128
But you have to walk the city
to know it.

79
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:39,971
Okay, but look,

80
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:43,363
Anything is better than getting
lost on the train every day.
Subway.

81
00:03:43,363 --> 00:03:45,394
Click those heels all you want.
You're not in portland anymore.

82
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:48,987
Seriously, you and dan
are so sweet to adopt me.

83
00:03:48,987 --> 00:03:50,999
I-I'd be a mess
without you guys.

84
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:53,378
Well, more of a mess
than i already am.

85
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:56,815
Red eye to go?
Yes, please. Thank you.
Hey, sarah.

86
00:03:56,815 --> 00:04:00,628
Sorry for talking your ear off
the other night, guys.
He tends to ramble,
as you'll get to know.

87
00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:01,050
Yeah.

88
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,503
<i>Well, i'm a good listener,
as he'll get to know.</i>

89
00:04:04,503 --> 00:04:05,925
Are there
any new developments?

90
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:08,050
Uh, no.
No, more of the same.

91
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,862
Jenny and her boyfriend
are still inseparable,

92
00:04:09,862 --> 00:04:12,050
And she's
even more insufferable.

93
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,690
Give her a break.
Asher's her first love.

94
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:18,175
It's infatuation.
It's not love.
Yeah,
but to a 15-Year-Old girl,

95
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,112
I mean, there really isn't
a difference.

96
00:04:20,437 --> 00:04:24,738
And how long
did it take you, dan?
Um... that's
a little different, vanessa.

97
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:27,425
It took me--
Uh, one glance at
a ninth grade birthday party?

98
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:31,175
Yes, but two years
to obsess over it.
So things are better with...

99
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:33,238
Serena?
Serena. Yeah.
Yeah, good memory.

100
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:35,362
Right.
Things are finally
back to normal.

101
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:38,550
Good. Well, i mean...

102
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,737
You know, it's--It's tough
making friends in a new city.

103
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,937
It'd be really nice
to meet her.
Yeah, serena would love you.

104
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:45,940
She loves everybody.
Not that she would only like you

105
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,800
Because she doesn't
discriminate. Um... ahem.

106
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,393
See what she meant
about that rambling thing?

107
00:04:51,138 --> 00:04:52,471
How's tonight?

108
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:54,204
Tonight would be perfect.

109
00:04:54,238 --> 00:04:55,871
(Hits countertop)
good. See you.

00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:07,304
(Kisses)
be right back.

112
00:05:07,338 --> 00:05:08,471
Okay.

113
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:11,237
(Jenny) oh, my god!

114
00:05:11,237 --> 00:05:13,138
He's so cute!

115
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:15,138
Hey, can i talk to you
for a minute?

116
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:16,804
Sure. Is something wrong?

117
00:05:16,837 --> 00:05:19,050
That's what i was gonna ask you.
Where have you been lately?

118
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,371
You haven't returned
any of my calls.
(Stammers) sorry.

119
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:24,238
It's been harder than i thought
to keep up with schoolwork

120
00:05:24,238 --> 00:05:25,800
And the new
spring social calendar

121
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,613
<i>And my new boyfriend.
Yeah. Asher, right?</i>

122
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:31,690
Yeah. He's cute and smart
and basically perfect,

123
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,675
<i>And the best part is
i think he really likes me.
Well, then he has good taste.</i>

124
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:37,675
But... how well
do you actually know him?

125
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:40,253
Oh, that's so sweet.
You're being protective.
No, i'm not.

126
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:43,238
But... yes. Yes, i am. I've got
nothing against him. I just...

127
00:05:43,238 --> 00:05:43,862
Something about him

128
00:05:43,862 --> 00:05:46,300
Makes me feel maybe he's not
the right guy for you.

129
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,363
Oh, my god. Wait. Do you have
a crush on me or something?
No, i don't. I just want you--

130
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:52,300
Don't be embarrassed.
It's cute.

131
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,128
I mean, and not so unexpected,
actually. I'm flattered.

132
00:05:55,128 --> 00:05:58,175
It's just...
my heart belongs to asher.

133
00:05:58,837 --> 00:06:01,104
I actually gotta go,
but, um, text me, 'kay?

134
00:06:01,138 --> 00:06:03,837
Oh. Bye.

135
00:06:05,471 --> 00:06:06,605
(Jenny) hey.

136
00:06:06,637 --> 00:06:08,637
(Penelope) hey, are you okay?
(Jenny) yeah.

137
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,404
What? You're here! (Laughs)

138
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:18,612
Mmm! And you're late.

139
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,800
Mm, i know. I come bearing
apologies and an invitation.

140
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,863
<i>What are you up to tonight?
I know what i'm not up to--
Having fun.</i>

141
00:06:24,863 --> 00:06:28,071
The s.A.T. Tutor was over
for four hours last night.

142
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:30,104
Mm. So this tutor,
is he--Is he cute?

143
00:06:30,138 --> 00:06:33,104
Mm, well, if hair in the ears
is your thing... (laughs)

144
00:06:33,138 --> 00:06:34,737
I hate that since
i'm not gonna

145
00:06:34,737 --> 00:06:36,112
Use the score
chuck bought for me,

146
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:37,300
I have to study every night.

147
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,972
I can't even
be distracted by that--

148
00:06:39,972 --> 00:06:41,425
Mmm. That.

149
00:06:43,894 --> 00:06:46,800
I see your point.
So then how about, um,

150
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,113
Dinner tonight
with sarah instead?

151
00:06:48,113 --> 00:06:49,691
Oh, sarah again?

152
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:52,487
What is she, your new girlfriend
or something?
Yeah. Just kidding.

153
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:54,534
But she's new in town,
and she does want to meet you.

154
00:06:54,534 --> 00:06:56,363
Well, since bart and chuck
are out of town,

155
00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:58,800
I already agreed to a quiet
family dinner in our old suite.

156
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,254
I'm sorry.
What about tomorrow?
No, my--My sister and tongue.

157
00:07:03,254 --> 00:07:06,863
The two things that don't
go together so well.
Oh! (Laughs) lighten up.

158
00:07:06,863 --> 00:07:08,750
You have been down on him
since the beginning.

159
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,253
Give him a chance
and then judge.

160
00:07:10,253 --> 00:07:13,454
Maybe he'll surprise you,
like i did.

161
00:07:13,504 --> 00:07:17,425
How are you always so right?
It's easy
whenyou'realways wrong.

162
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:18,612
Hey, you got
first period free.

163
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:22,237
Why don't you go
get to know him? Go! Okay.
Okay. All right, okay.

164
00:07:32,972 --> 00:07:36,940
&&&&&&&&&

165
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,800
*********

166
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,425
%%%%%%%%%

167
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,300
<i>And the only thing</i>

168
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,519
<i>More shocking
than the truth...</i>

169
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,999
<i>Are the lies people tell</i>

170
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:55,784
<i>To cover it up.</i>

171
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,753
When you revise
the seating chart,

172
00:08:13,753 --> 00:08:15,719
Don't forget
to place mr. Spipitzer

173
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:18,053
As far away
from serena's table

174
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:19,387
As possible.

175
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,053
Thank you.

176
00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:23,220
<i>Ugh. What is not
on the schedule today?</i>

177
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,454
I don't think i am.

178
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,719
Maybe you could
fit me in beeen

179
00:08:28,753 --> 00:08:31,087
Preston bailey
and sylvia weinstock?

180
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,420
Well, good luck fitting
anything between those two.

181
00:08:33,454 --> 00:08:36,420
What--What are you doing here?
Well, believe it or not,
i'm here to see you.

182
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:39,953
Well, i have a laundry list
of things to do today.
It's about jenny.

183
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,087
Alison's away
on an artists' retreat,

184
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,737
And i could really use
a mother's advice.

185
00:08:43,737 --> 00:08:45,862
I think i might be in
over my head.

186
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:49,300
I suppose we could
talk about it on the way.

187
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,238
??????

188
00:08:57,853 --> 00:08:59,387
(Asher) hey.

189
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,187
What's going on?
See you later.

190
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,441
Hey, asher. How's it going?
You got a minute?

191
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:07,112
Yeah. Uh, but just a minute.
Jenny and i have a lunch date.

192
00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:09,300
Well, look, there's no easy
way to say this, honestly,

193
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,440
So i'm just gonna--
I'm just gonna say it.

194
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,691
I-I, uh, saw you
this morning.

195
00:09:14,691 --> 00:09:18,550
Saw me what?
I saw you... you know,
i saw you kissing that guy.

196
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,612
You got the wrong person.
Come on, man.
I-I-I don't think i do.

197
00:09:21,612 --> 00:09:24,925
Are you calling me queer?
That's... not at all
what i said.

198
00:09:24,925 --> 00:09:27,220
You wanna know
how queer i am?

199
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:28,886
<i>I'm so queer,</i>

200
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,387
I'm gonna pop
your sister's cherry tonight.

201
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,320
Hey! What'd you say?!

202
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:35,753
What are you doing? Stop it!
Jenny, i need
to talk to you in private.

203
00:09:35,786 --> 00:09:37,113
Well, anything you have
to say to me,

204
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:40,613
You can say
in front of my boyfriend.
Re--Okay. All right, fine.

205
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:45,769
Your boyfriend is not
being honest with you.
I wasn't gonna
tell you yet, but i...

206
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:47,920
Wanted to invite you to
the country house this weekend.

207
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:51,320
Your brother thought we were
moving too fast and got upset.

208
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:53,320
Dan, can't you just
let me be happy for once?

209
00:09:53,353 --> 00:09:55,362
Jenny, i want you to be happy.
Just not with a guy who--

210
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,487
Yeah, i understand
that you're threatened by him,

211
00:09:57,487 --> 00:09:59,378
Because clearly
he's everything you wanna be.

212
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:03,222
He's good-Looking and worldly,
a legacy at dartmouth.

213
00:10:03,222 --> 00:10:03,925
But even you should know

214
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:06,769
That jealousy clashes
with l.L.Bean pants.

215
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,053
<i>It's a snub
from one party, b.</i>

216
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:17,387
Plus what's the big deal anyway?
You don't even like asher.

217
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,800
I didn't like last season's

218
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
Louis vuitton patchwork bag
either, but that doesn't mean

219
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,719
I want to see it all over town
on jenny humphrey's arm.
Touch?

220
00:10:24,753 --> 00:10:28,287
What do you say we have
a girls' night out tonight?
Oh, i'm sorry. I can't.
I have dinner with the family.

221
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,886
Let me remind you
of a little promise you made.

222
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,886
"Don't go to france.
I'll be there for you."

223
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,886
I'm really sorry
i've been distant,

224
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,454
But things will
be better soon, i promise.
Obviously starting tomorrow.

225
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:39,686
Hey.
Hey.

226
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:42,287
What's wrong?
You look stressed, even for you.

227
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,087
I'm still worried
about jenny.

228
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,619
You mean because
she's self-Obsessed,

229
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:47,187
Self-Serving,
self-Centered, self--

230
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,565
No. No, i wish it was
about her and herself,

231
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,925
<i>But it's more about
who she's with.</i>

232
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:53,878
I can't get through to her.

233
00:10:53,878 --> 00:10:56,644
I tried, and she just
completely blew me off,

234
00:10:56,644 --> 00:10:58,586
<i>And she dissed my pants.</i>

235
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:00,653
Maybe i underestimated her.

236
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:03,520
She's just going through
a phase. We all went through it.

237
00:11:03,554 --> 00:11:05,719
<i>And apparently,
some of us still are in it.</i>

238
00:11:05,753 --> 00:11:07,853
All that matters
to someone like jenny right now

239
00:11:07,886 --> 00:11:10,353
Are the four g's--Guys,
girlfriends and gossip girl.

240
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:12,187
It's true. Don't feel bad.

241
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,800
Unless it's coming
from one of them,

242
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,550
She's not gonna hear it.

243
00:11:24,454 --> 00:11:25,488
(Man) here we go.

244
00:11:25,488 --> 00:11:26,565
Ah, thank you.

245
00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:29,425
I tell her she can't see asher.
She calls him.

246
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:32,487
I take away her phone.
They're on ichat.

247
00:11:32,487 --> 00:11:34,287
How do you keep them
from growing up

248
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,987
When they can have
a full relationship

249
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,786
From the confines
of their own bedrooms?
Well, the answer is
you can't.

250
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,020
She's gonna grow up
no matter what.
I read her e-Mail.

251
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:46,520
Well, you can't be too concerned
about their privacy

252
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:48,520
When their well-Being
is at stake,

253
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:52,454
Especially if you think
they're lying to you. Was she?
Right to my face.

254
00:11:52,487 --> 00:11:54,786
I know serena went through
a similar phase.

255
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,363
Well, if serena's indiscretions
were as p.G. As jenny's,

256
00:11:58,363 --> 00:12:00,566
I wouldn't have needed
the botox.

257
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:02,269
Dan was so much easier.

258
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:03,554
Well, raising girls
is different.

259
00:12:03,586 --> 00:12:06,378
Serena would be a horrible
monster for a hundred days,

260
00:12:06,378 --> 00:12:08,554
And then on the 101st,

261
00:12:08,586 --> 00:12:10,554
She'd be
my little girl again.

262
00:12:12,175 --> 00:12:13,675
So i just wait and hope, huh?

263
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:15,394
Well,
that's the hardest part.

264
00:12:15,394 --> 00:12:18,925
You have to trust
that you've done your job.

265
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:20,420
She'll come back to you.

266
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,613
(Gasps) that's...

267
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:27,487
It's perfect.

268
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,619
Beautiful.
It's my finest piece.
Mm-Hmm.

269
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,487
Here.

270
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,586
Let me.

271
00:12:40,112 --> 00:12:41,986
Mark ingram, it's beautiful.

272
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,586
You've outdone yourself.
Oh, wow.

273
00:12:45,893 --> 00:12:47,087
<i>This just in--</i>

274
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,454
<i>Asher hornsby spotted
locking lips before class...</i>

275
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:52,487
<i>But not with his girlfriend.</i>

276
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:55,362
<i>Looks like gentlemen
don't prefer blondes, little j.</i>

277
00:12:55,362 --> 00:12:57,420
<i>They prefer other gentlemen.</i>

278
00:12:57,454 --> 00:12:59,768
Now you know
how vanessa hudgens feels.

279
00:12:59,768 --> 00:13:01,581
<i>Is this just
another round of blanks</i>

280
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,206
<i>Fired between b. And little j.?</i>

281
00:13:03,206 --> 00:13:05,853
<i>I'm tired of being
the bearer of bad grudges.</i>

282
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:08,520
<i>This is the last item that goes
to press without proof.</i>

283
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,686
I'm so glad gossip girl
finally got her balls back.

284
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:13,862
Yeah, she was totally turning
into the new "page six."

285
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:17,420
Low blow.
Wasn't me. Wish it was.

286
00:13:21,187 --> 00:13:22,550
Hello?
(Man) miss van derwoodsen?

287
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,237
It's luke
from the concierge's desk.

288
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,113
You asked that we call first

289
00:13:25,113 --> 00:13:27,941
Before delivering anything
upstairs?
Is there something for me?

290
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:31,238
Yes, a package
from a miss georgina sparks.

291
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:35,487
Hello? Did i lose you?

292
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:38,628
Uh, no.
Uh, just keep it there.

293
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:39,987
I'll pick it up
right after school.

294
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,628
And don't let it
out of your sight.

295
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:43,050
Of course.
Thank you.

296
00:13:43,253 --> 00:13:46,220
What was that about?
Nothing. It's just this...

297
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:48,586
Nothing. I'll see you later,
okay? Bye.

298
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,554
Bye. Hey...

299
00:13:50,586 --> 00:13:51,920
Hey, b.

300
00:13:51,953 --> 00:13:54,853
Dan humphrey--Just who i hate
to admit i was looking for.

301
00:13:54,886 --> 00:13:56,020
You're dirty.

302
00:13:56,053 --> 00:13:57,253
Wha--Uh, what are you
talking about?

303
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,420
Cheating, drinking, drugs--
It's all fair game.

304
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:02,420
But outing
your sister's boyfriend is dark.

305
00:14:02,454 --> 00:14:04,786
How did squeaky-Clean humphrey
even come up with that?

306
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,786
(Sighs) i didn't
come up with anything.
Oh, my god.

307
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,719
You know something.
Spill it.

308
00:14:09,753 --> 00:14:12,187
Yeah, i-I might have seen asher
kissing another guy.

309
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,253
So it's true?
Who was he kissing?

310
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,050
I don't know. I don't--
I don't know. I couldn't see.

311
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,487
But what does that
even matter?
Right now
gossip girl's credibility is

312
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:21,238
The same as tinsely mortimer's
after a few martinis.

313
00:14:21,238 --> 00:14:22,612
But if i can prove
that his duplicity

314
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,394
Is more than just a rumor,
then they'll break up.

315
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:27,456
That's what you want, isn't it?
Well, yeah, i guess. Yeah--

316
00:14:27,456 --> 00:14:29,800
Asher's just
using your sister as a cover.

317
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,112
It's your brotherly duty
to save her from becoming

318
00:14:32,112 --> 00:14:34,862
The next katie holmes.
And you're in this
to help jenny?

319
00:14:34,862 --> 00:14:38,113
Motive is irrelevant as long
as our endgame is the same.
No, blair,

320
00:14:38,113 --> 00:14:42,112
This is not a game to me, okay?
I don't want her to get hurt.
Well, you should've
thought that through

321
00:14:42,112 --> 00:14:45,254
Before you told all of manhattan
that jenny's a glorified hag.

322
00:14:46,203 --> 00:14:48,675
(Sighs) you know what?
I--You're on your own.

323
00:14:49,141 --> 00:14:50,237
I'm done.

324
00:14:50,387 --> 00:14:52,287
Suit yourself.

325
00:14:57,425 --> 00:14:59,363
(Lily) really, rufus.
What were you thinking?

326
00:14:59,363 --> 00:15:01,363
You threw her
a surprise birthday party

327
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:05,441
And had her face painted
on a cake with a tiara?

328
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:06,566
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

329
00:15:06,566 --> 00:15:09,113
Yeah, well, so did flannel
and acid-Washed jeans,

330
00:15:09,113 --> 00:15:10,879
But they weren't
flattering either.

331
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:19,999
What is it?

332
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:21,800
Is it too much?

333
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:27,081
Uh, is it not enough?

334
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,999
It's not the dress.
It's you in it.

335
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,738
I'm sorry. I thought...

336
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,513
I didn't mean...

337
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:52,313
We're here as friends,
right?

338
00:15:54,941 --> 00:15:56,550
<i>No, we are friends.</i>

339
00:15:57,487 --> 00:15:58,925
It's just how you look.

340
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:08,862
Nothing new on "gossip girl"
for three hours.

341
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:11,628
Guess she wasn't kidding
about her new standards.
Hey, jenny!

342
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:12,363
Oh!
Sorry, i can't chat,

343
00:16:12,363 --> 00:16:14,996
But have so much fun
at your party tonight.

344
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:17,362
<i>She's totally running to
a booty call with your brother.</i>

345
00:16:17,362 --> 00:16:20,729
<i>I cannot believe
you just went there.
And where have you gone,
little j.?</i>

346
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:23,529
Yeah, you and asher.
Enough.

347
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:26,862
<i>Playing coy
only means one thing.
Maybe asher doesn't like girls.</i>

348
00:16:26,896 --> 00:16:29,395
Is that why
we went to third?
You went to third?

349
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:31,862
<i>No, he did.</i>

350
00:16:31,896 --> 00:16:34,929
Well done.
Make him work for it.

351
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:39,050
Whoever said that money
doesn't buy happiness

352
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,613
Didn't know where to shop.

353
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:43,409
Lucky for me, i may have
to go out tonight after all.

354
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:46,737
Did you get it?
Lucky for you, is knows
five ways to sneak into

355
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:49,737
The unity boys' locker room,
and six to sneak out.

356
00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:53,988
Asher takes an abnormally long
shower after practice.
Maybe his lacrosse stick

357
00:16:53,988 --> 00:16:55,999
Isn't the only thing
he likes to play with.

358
00:16:56,175 --> 00:16:58,113
(Laughs) why'd you want
his phone so badly anyway?
It was once said

359
00:16:58,113 --> 00:17:01,050
That a person's eyes
are the windows to their soul.

360
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,362
That was before
people had cell phones.

361
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,612
Hey.

362
00:17:19,688 --> 00:17:20,987
This is a surprise.

363
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,925
(Kisses)
party's not
for a couple hours.

364
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:27,659
Yeah, well, a lot can happen
in a couple hours.

365
00:17:31,393 --> 00:17:32,693
Uh, jenny.
(Chuckles nervously)

366
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:34,992
What are you doing?
What's wrong?

367
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:37,226
It--Nothing's wrong.

368
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:39,737
This... it just isn't
what we do.

369
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,331
Are you suddenly...

370
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:44,925
Not happy? I...

371
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,222
I'm holding up
my end of the bargain.

372
00:17:47,222 --> 00:17:48,425
What bargain?

373
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:51,206
You're jenny humphrey
from brooklyn.

374
00:17:51,206 --> 00:17:53,629
You need status,
access, resources.

375
00:17:53,629 --> 00:17:56,737
<i>I give that to you.
What do i give you?</i>

376
00:17:56,737 --> 00:17:59,113
<i>Do we really need
to talk about this?</i>

377
00:17:59,113 --> 00:18:01,925
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we do.

378
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:05,363
So what was on
"gossip girl's" true?

379
00:18:05,363 --> 00:18:07,832
<i>Do you really think
someone like me</i>

380
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:10,221
<i>Would just date
someone like you?</i>

381
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,737
But you've been so nice.

382
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:15,800
<i>And i'll keep being nice.
Nothing has to change, okay?</i>

383
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:16,846
Asher...

384
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:17,925
Come on, jenny.

385
00:18:17,925 --> 00:18:18,941
Tonight you're hosting

386
00:18:18,941 --> 00:18:21,754
Your first
upper east side party.

387
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,925
That's something
that blair and those girls

388
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:26,738
Can never take away
from you.

389
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,488
I know. Thank you.

390
00:18:28,488 --> 00:18:30,300
You're welcome. And...

391
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,738
<i>There is something you can do
to show your thanks.</i>

392
00:18:34,421 --> 00:18:38,050
I think it would be better
for both of us

393
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,112
If we put those rumors to rest
once and for all.

394
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,300
What do you want me to do?

395
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:58,550
&&&&&&&&&

396
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,999
<i>(Georgina)
if you put the camera here,</i>

397
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:27,175
<i>She'll never know.
(Man) are you sure
she's gonna be down for this?</i>

398
00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:30,237
<i>It's serena.
She goes down for anything.</i>

399
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:34,237
<i>So how's the new
mr. And mrs. Shepherd?</i>

400
00:19:34,237 --> 00:19:36,441
<i>(Serena) i just
did something so stupid.</i>

401
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,941
<i>(Serena)
it's hot. I'm too hot.</i>

402
00:19:39,941 --> 00:19:41,863
<i>(Man) you're hot.</i>

403
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,600
Where do you think
you're going?

404
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,400
I can't talk right now, mom.
I'll explain later.

405
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,000
If you invite an old friend
to our quiet family dinner,

406
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,800
I expect you to stay and eat.

407
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,100
You know how i always loved
when georgina came around.

408
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,200
I ran into lily
in the lobby.

409
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,500
<i>You totally forgot to tell her
i was coming over for dinner.</i>

410
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,300
Did you get my present?

411
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,200
<i>(Gossip girl) breaking news--</i>

412
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,300
<i>Asher hornsby
overheard bragging</i>

413
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,200
<i>That little j. Swiped
her "v" card at his register.</i>

414
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,700
Jenny, is this true?

415
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,600
It's private.

416
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,200
It's on the internet.
Yeah, well,
it's none of your business.

417
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,600
And since when

418
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,700
Did you start reading
"gossip girl" blasts anyway?

419
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,700
Since you became
the subject of them.

420
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,600
You're 15 years old,
and i'm your big brother.

421
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,600
<i>It is my business.
Well, it's not true.</i>

422
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,900
You happy?
Oh. W--

423
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,200
You can't tell anyone, though.
Everyone has to believe it.

424
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,300
W--Are--Are you saying

425
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,900
That you actually
want your friends to think

426
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,400
<i>That you're sleeping with
a guy who's gay?
Do you believe everything</i>

427
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,800
I didn't read it. I saw it.

428
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,600
<i>So you were the one
who sent the tip?
Yeah, i'm--Look, i'm sorry,</i>

429
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,800
But i tried to tell you.
You wouldn't listen to me.

430
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,300
I needed to get
your attention somehow.

431
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,300
Well, i knew about him
the whole time.

432
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,800
So...
so you let him use you?

433
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,100
<i>Well, maybe i was using him.
Did you ever think of that?</i>

434
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,000
I don't know which is worse.
(Scoffs)
for once in your life,

435
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,400
Could you just
stop judging everyone?
No, i'm not. I'm--

436
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,300
You think that you're
so different and so good?

437
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,300
Well, guess what, dan?

438
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,100
The minute that you start
sending tips to gossip girl,

439
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,000
You're in the game
with the rest of us.

440
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,200
Get out of my room.
Hey... (sighs)

441
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,700
B., now's not a good time.

442
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,500
It's important.
Look, i know i told you
i'd be more available,

443
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,700
But i just can't right now.
But it can't wait.

444
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,800
Sorry. It was just blair.

445
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,100
Oh. How is snow white?

446
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,400
Uh, snow not so white.
Did you hear that she and--
Eric.

447
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,200
So, georgina, what brings you
back to new york?

448
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,700
Oh, i just had some time
to kill.
She went to boarding school

449
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,400
Oh, your parents
must be happy you're back.
Oh, no.

450
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,500
Actually, they've moved
to the country full-Time.

451
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,600
I'm just in the city to catch up
with some old friends.

452
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,700
What about you?

453
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,200
<i>You and that gorgeous
tiffany rock</i>

454
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,900
Seem to be
the talk of the city.
Thank you. (Laughs)

455
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,300
Mr. Bass and i
are very, um, happy.

456
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,100
You look it. You all do.

457
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,400
I mean, there must be love
in the new york air.

458
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,800
You're engaged,
serena's found a new guy,

459
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,900
Eric found himself a boyfriend.

460
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,600
Excuse me?

461
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,300
Oh, i-I'm sorry. I don't think
i heard you right.

462
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,600
What? You haven't met
serena's new guy?
(Lily) a boyfriend?

463
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,300
Oh. You mean eric.

464
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,400
You didn't know
he was dating someone?

465
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,000
I... didn't think
it was a secre

466
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,400
I mean, i saw them kissing in
front of st. Jude's this morning

467
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,000
For all the world to see.

468
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Well, don't look
so embarrassed, e.

469
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,400
He is a hot piece! Well done.

470
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
Please, georgina.
It's not funny, okay?

471
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,900
You--You didn't know
eric was dating a boy.

472
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,600
This doesn't make any sense,
because that would mean...

473
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,500
That eric is...

474
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,700
And he's not.

475
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,500
(Whispers) he's just not.

476
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,500
Are you?

477
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,300
Oh, god.

478
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,500
Eric.

479
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,900
Great, mom.
That's just great.

480
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,400
How dare you?

481
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,300
(Playing guitar)
dan went out with vanessa,
and i'm going to choir practice

482
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,800
Like we talked about.
Don't wait up.
Not so fast.

483
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,700
Where were you gonna
change your clothes?

484
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,200
We don't wear a uniform
for rehearsal.

485
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,000
Well, unless the choir is
entertainment at asher's party,

486
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,400
You have
some explaining to do.

487
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
How'd you know
about the party?

488
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,400
I know a lot more
than you think i do.

489
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,900
Nice dress.

490
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,800
I wanted one night out, okay?
What was i supposed to do?
Ask my permission.

491
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Well, you would've said no.
You're probably right,

492
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,400
But that's no excuse
to lie to me.
(Scoffs) dad, you don't

493
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,700
<i>I'm throwing this party!
Not anymore you're not.</i>

494
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,600
You need to call asher
and tell him you're not coming.
I can't.

495
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,000
All my friends--
You heard me.

496
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,400
I promised.
All that good behavior
from the past few weeks

497
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,300
Just got wiped out
from that lie.
You can't stop me, all right?

498
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,900
Jenny, if you walk out
that door, i--

499
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,100
You'll what?! What, dad?
What are you gonna do?

500
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,500
Are you gonna
put bars on my wadow

501
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,400
Or chain me
to the kitchen counter?

502
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,100
I'm not your...

503
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,000
I'm not
a little girl anymore.

504
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,300
You can't make me do
anything.

505
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,500
You've already lost my trust.
(Opens door)

506
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,100
You really wanna
lose my respect, too?

507
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,600
I'm sorry.

508
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,500
Yeah. Okay.
(Knock on door)

509
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,600
Hey, it's me.

510
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,900
Bye.

511
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,900
Who are you talking to?

512
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,000
Chuck.

513
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,800
What, you called chuck?

514
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,800
Yeah. I've been talking
to him a lot lately.

515
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Guy's got his faults,
but he's never judged me.

516
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,200
I'm your sister.

517
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,000
We're us.

518
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,600
You can tell me anything.

519
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,800
<i>I wanted to,</i>

520
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
But it... it's--It's not
the type of thing

521
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You blurt out
on the way to school.

522
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,100
I was waiting
for the right time.

523
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,200
Dinner with georgina
definitely wasn't at all.

524
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,900
I'm sorry about her...

525
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,100
About me.

526
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,900
I came back for you,

527
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,100
And then i abandoned you
all over again.

528
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,900
This isn't like before.

529
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,200
I'm fine, really.

530
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,400
Well, i'm here now.

531
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
When i was at ostroff,
i met this guy.

532
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,500
We were going through
a lot of the same stuff,

533
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,100
And now that guy
is dating jenny.

534
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Wait, you're the mystery guy
that asher was spotted kissing?

535
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,100
I know this isn't
how you wanted this to happen.

536
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,700
Yeah, i guess
the important thing

537
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,000
Is that it's happening.

538
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,800
I'm so proud of you.

539
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,600
I love you, no matter...

540
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,300
What you do, who you like,

541
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
Whose boyfriend kisses you.

542
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
(Chuckles)
the people who care about you

543
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,900
Will always
stand by your side, okay?
(Whispers) yeah.

544
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,800
(Normal voice) i think
i'm gonna drop by asher's party.

545
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,000
There's one more person
i have to talk to.

546
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,700
Oh, my god.
Blair crashed jenny's party.

547
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,400
You look...
i know.

548
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,000
Jenny's gonna freak.
Watch and learn, ladies.

549
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,500
The most important parties
to attend

550
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,300
Are the ones
you're not invited to.

551
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,000
Where's the host?
I have something for him.

552
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,100
<i>* me on my way to you </i>

553
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,600
Oh, thank god you're here.
I'm so happy to see you.
Hey.

554
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,700
I'm happy to see you, too.
You can meet sarah.
Oh, i'd love to,

555
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,200
But now is really not
a good time.

556
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,400
Well, she's here, so, uh...
sarah, serena. Serena, sarah.

557
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
Hi. I'm sarah.

558
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,200
It is so nice
to finally meet you.

559
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,600
Wow. I mean...

560
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,300
Dan told me you were pretty,
but he didn't do you justice.

561
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,900
Dan, can we talk
in private, please?
Hey, no, no, no. Wait.

562
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,200
Don't go. Vanessa was just about
to show me one of her movies.

563
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,000
I'm a filmmaker, too,
of sorts.

564
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,900
Actually, i brought
one of my short films.

565
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,900
I was hoping
to get your opinion.

566
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,800
Maybe you wanna see it, too,
and tell me what you think?

567
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,400
I'll go get my laptop.

568
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,100
Dan, would you get me
a coffee? Please?

569
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,000
Yeah.

570
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,900
What the hell are you doing,
georgina? Put that away.

571
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,000
Aw, come on.
I'm just having a little fun.

572
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,400
Remember? Like old times.

573
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,200
You and me pretending
to be different people--

574
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,300
Svetlana and savannah.
This is not a game.

575
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,900
I don't know how
you even filmed that,

576
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,400
But i'm not
playing with you this time.
It's just a friendly game.

577
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,900
But we're not friends.

578
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,900
(Clicks tongue) oh...
i think we are.

579
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,600
You see, because with me
as your enemy,

580
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,900
Dan sees this.

581
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,200
And if the heavy petting
doesn't send him running,

582
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,200
<i>Well, i'll bet
what happened after will.
(Dan) hey.</i>

583
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,800
What'd we miss?
Nothing.

584
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,600
It's like sarah and have
known each other for years.

585
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,100
Oh. Great.

586
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,800
We don't need the laptop
anymore. Thanks.

587
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,700
No, i got a little shy
about showing it.

588
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,100
Maybe next time?

589
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,900
Okay.

590
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,900
So was it as special
as you hoped it would be?

591
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,600
<i>'Cause yours totally wasn't.
And yours was?</i>

592
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,700
(Man) ladies, your drinks.

593
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,600
I mean, yeah.
(Clink)

594
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,300
<i>Asher made me feel
really safe.
You are so lucky.</i>

595
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,800
Mmm, i know.

596
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,700
You guys, blair is here.
What is she doing here?
She wasn't invited.

597
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,700
We need to talk.

598
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,400
Give us a moment, guys.

599
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,100
I thought
you might want this back.

600
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,100
<i>Whatever you found,
it's not what it looks like.
It's always</i>

601
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,800
And judging by
the texts and photos,

602
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,000
It looks like a little more
than friendship.
What are you

603
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,200
Well, lucky for you,

604
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,000
<i>Your friend is someone
i actually care about,</i>

605
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,100
Or i would've used them
against you and jenny already.

606
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,200
Too bad you don't
care about him the same way.

607
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,700
It's okay, blair.
I can handle this.

608
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,000
What's he doing here?
What is she doing here?

609
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,500
Are you gonna tell her,
or am i?
There's nothing to tell.

610
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,300
Gossip girl was right.

611
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,400
Asher was kissing someone
this morning... me.
(Girl) oh!

612
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,300
He's totally lying.
Tell him, jenny.

613
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,000
I was with you all morning.

614
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,500
Yeah. Asher's right.

615
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,500
<i>I was with him.
Eric's lying.</i>

616
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,400
Why would i stand here,
in front of everyone we know,

617
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,100
And tell them
if it wasn't true?

618
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,100
I'm gay...

619
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,400
And so are you.

620
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,500
Get this faggot
out of here!

621
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,900
Go ahead and do it.

622
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,400
What did you just do?

623
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,500
You'll see.

624
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,400
What kind of mother does not
know that her son is gay?

625
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,500
The people you know best

626
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,000
Are the ones most capable
of surprising you.

627
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,900
The things that i said,
the way i acted...

628
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,400
<i>It was not
my finest maternal moment.</i>

629
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,700
What if
he does something again?

630
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,900
I know how much you love him.
So does he.

631
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,900
You just need
to remind him of that.

632
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But what if it's not enough?
Most of the time,
it's all we've got.

633
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,500
And what about you?
What are you gonna do?

634
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,700
I'm gonna wait for my daughter
to come to me,

635
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,300
And then i'm gonna ground her
until she's 25. (Chuckles)

636
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,500
Ah, we make
quite the team, huh?

637
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,200
Always did.

638
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,700
Good luck, lil,

639
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,100
With everything.

640
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,600
I'm sure you'll make
a beautiful bride.

641
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Mm, thank you.

642
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,400
Good night, rufus.

643
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,700
<i>Weekend update--</i>

644
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,800
<i>A same-Sex kiss hasn't caused
this much controversy</i>

645
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,600
<i>Since britney and madonna.</i>

646
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,600
<i>Looks like little j. Didn't
spread her legs after all.</i>

647
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,600
<i>She spread lies instead.</i>

648
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,900
<i>Asher is gay,</i>

649
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,900
<i>And i have the correspondence
to prove it.</i>

650
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,500
Looks like someone needs
a semester in france.

651
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,300
(Penelope) get your things,
girls. We're leaving.

652
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,900
Guys, we can still have fun.
Don't leave.

653
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,900
It's kind of hard to party
after the gay bomb drops.
I'm gonna do something

654
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,300
And give you
the benefit of the doubt.

655
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,200
Tells us gossip girl
is wrong.

656
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,000
Did you or did you not
sleep with asher?

657
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,200
I... may have exaggerated
a little bit.

658
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,400
Dating a gay guy
is an honest mistake,

659
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,000
But lying to your girlfriends
about sex is unforgivable.

660
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,900
To think,

661
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,500
I almost asked you to wear
a matching dress tonight.

662
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,300
You're branded now
with the "l" word.

663
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,000
"Liar."

664
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,700
So what are we doing
tonight?

665
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,500
<i>We are doing nothing.</i>

666
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,400
I, however, am going home.

667
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,500
But, um...

668
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,300
Tomorrow,
dinner at the waverly

669
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,500
And then to 151 for drinks.
Yeah.

670
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,600
I'll have dorota blackberry
everyone an itinerary.

671
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,800
<i>Don't look so sad, little j.</i>

672
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,700
<i>The sun will come out
tomorrow...</i>

673
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,200
<i>Even though
your boyfriend did today.</i>

674
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,600
Hey, um, i made...

675
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,600
Uh, some tea.

676
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,300
Um, it's probably
iced now, but, um...

677
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,500
Look, my reaction earlier--
It's okay, mom.

678
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,000
<i>No, it's not okay.</i>

679
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,700
You just caught me off guard.
I guess i...

680
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,000
I just wasn't ready.

681
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,700
Well, i wasn't ready either,
so...

682
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,200
It's okay if you need time.

683
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,200
Well...

684
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,300
Since you're being
so honest,

685
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,000
I'm gonna, um,
to try as well, okay?

686
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,600
(Whispers) i'm scared.

687
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,600
(Normal voice) and life is
tough enough as it is, you know?

688
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,000
I want...
i want the best for you.

689
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,100
And, um...

690
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,700
I'm worried for your safety
and your happiness.

691
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,100
I have a better chance
of being happy if i'm honest.

692
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,400
I know that,

693
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,700
And i want you to know
what love is...

694
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,200
Whoever you're with,

695
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,700
(Whispers)
because it's pretty great.

696
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,400
You would know, right?

697
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,700
Fourth time's the charm.

698
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,900
<i>Ah, yes,</i>

699
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,800
<i>The truth always comes out.</i>

700
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,400
<i>It's one of
the fundamental rules of time.</i>

701
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,200
<i>And when it comes out,
it can set you free...</i>

702
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,600
<i>Or end everything
you fought so hard for.</i>

703
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,800
My, my. If it isn't little j.,
risen from the ashes.

704
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,500
I came to tell you
in person...

705
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,400
You win.

706
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,300
(Chuckles) oh, sweetie.
We just started to play.

707
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,000
No, you don't understand.

708
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,400
I'm done...

709
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,400
With you, with them,

710
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
With all of it.

711
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,600
Just like that,
you wave the white flag?

712
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,900
I lied, and i stole,

713
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,100
And i lost the respect
of my family... for what?

714
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,700
So i can be like you?

715
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,000
You asked me before
if it was all worth it.

716
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,600
My answer is, it's not.

717
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,400
I tried to warn you...

718
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,400
There's a price to pay.

719
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,600
I always knew a girl like you
couldn't afford it.

720
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,200
Well, you were right.

721
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,100
Well, you put up
a good fight...

722
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,600
For a freshman.

723
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,000
Thanks.

724
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,300
I hope
you don't expect a hug.

725
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,600
I don't expect anything
anymore.

726
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,700
So... (sighs) she's great,
right? What do you think?

727
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,100
Honestly, there's something
i don't really like about her.

728
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,200
Okay, but you had your doubts
about vanessa in the beginning,

729
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,900
And now you guys are friends.
This is different.

730
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,900
(Sighs) i-I don't understand
why you--You're...

731
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,600
Why i'm what?

732
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,500
Jealous.
There's no reason to be.

733
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,800
She--She actually wanted us
to patch things up.

734
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,300
What, you told her
about our problems?

735
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,100
Yes, because she wanted
to listen to them,

736
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,100
And she had good advice, too.
Look at me. I love you, okay?

737
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,300
You just have
to take my word for it.

738
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,500
Do not trust her.

739
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
But you just met her. I...

740
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,000
You know, you've been
hanging out with chuck

741
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,500
And you've been partying
and avoiding me and lying,

742
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,700
And y-You're trying to tell me
who i can ancannot trust?

743
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,000
I-I don't understand that
at all.

744
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,300
You know,

745
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,300
We--We all live
in brooklyn, so...

746
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:51,600
I don't know.

747
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,700
If--If you need to catch a cab,
i think you should do that here.

748
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,100
Dan, don't. I want to talk.

749
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,800
<i>Then talk.</i>

750
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,100
(Vanessa)
i'm gonna get going.

751
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,300
Hey, just hold on.
One--One second.

752
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,700
I forgot something inside.
I'll catch up with you guys?

753
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,500
(Vanessa) okay.

754
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,700
Well, i had fun.

755
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,800
How about you?
What do you want from me?

756
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,800
I want things to go back to how
they were before that night,

757
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,000
Before things
got so screwed up.

758
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,400
<i>We were such good friends,
and now we can be again.</i>

759
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,300
Why would i want to be friends
with somebody who blackmails me,

760
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,700
Who outs my little brother
at the dinner table?

761
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,500
Eric was an honest mistake.
I would never hurt him.

762
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,400
No, i don't believe you.

763
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,900
I don't believe you about eric,
about anything.

764
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,000
Maybe you're right.

765
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
Maybe i did it on purpose.

766
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,200
(Chuckles) because i can,

767
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,000
Because i know things

768
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,300
About you,
about your family,

769
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,800
About your boyfriend,

770
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,400
And i know them
before you do.

771
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,600
Oh, look. Cab.

772
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,100
You get home safe.

773
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,400
Hold up, guys! I'm coming.

774
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,100
<i>Another way
the truth comes out</i>

775
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,500
<i>When you don't even
mean it to...</i>

776
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,400
"Angry,"

777
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
"Change,"

778
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,100
"Trust,"

779
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,100
"Girl."

780
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,800
Somethin' you wanna
talk about?

781
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,100
Who would have thought scrabble
could be so therapeutic?

782
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,200
That last one was
a triple word score.

783
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,200
<i>Or when,</i>

784
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,000
<i>Without saying a word,</i>

785
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,300
<i>It's still loud and clear.</i>

786
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,200
Dad?

787
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,100
(Softly) do you think
it'd be okay if i joined you?

788
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,300
You know there's always
room for you here.

789
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,700
Yeah, and dad's totally losing,
so he could use your help.

790
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,500
(Crying) dad, i'm sorry.

791
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,400
(Whispers) oh.
I'm sorry about everything.

792
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,100
<i>But the worst thing
the truth can do</i>

793
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,800
<i>Is when you finally tell it,</i>

794
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,400
<i>It doesn't set you free,
but locks you away forever.</i>

795
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,100
(Voice breaks) blair?

796
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,400
Serena, what are you
doing here? It's late.

797
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,300
Oh, my god.

798
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,400
(Crying)
what happened? What's wrong?

799
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,000
Talk to me.
I can't.

800
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,100
Of course you can.

801
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,900
No. No, b., this is
the one thing i can't tell you.

802
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,300
I can't tell anyone.

803
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,700
I-I'm not anyone. I'm me.
You can tell me anything.

804
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,300
No, i can't...

805
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,800
(Sniffles) because then
that'd make you a part of it,

806
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,100
And you can't
be a part of this.

807
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,600
What are you talking about?
You're starting to scare me.

808
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,200
Hey, hey, hey.
We're sisters.

809
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,500
You're my family.
What is you, is me.

810
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,300
There's nothing that you could
ever say to make me let go.

811
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,700
I love you.

812
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,000
What is it?

813
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,000
I killed someone.

814
