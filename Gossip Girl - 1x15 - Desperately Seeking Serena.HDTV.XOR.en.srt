Here--your one and only source

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,930
Into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,960
I got three cases of champagne for Serena Van Der Woodsen.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,200
For me? Who's it from?

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,800
Porn and handcuffs? This is low,Chuck,even for you.

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,160
What's this? Chuck said it came for you this morning. Whoa. Is that coke?

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,430
How do you like a brother who uses you as a drug mule?

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,200
- I can't believe you think Chuck is doing these things.  - What's he done now?

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,660
I'll tell you what he's done. If we're gonna exist under the same roof,

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,930
- I am laying down some house rules.  - No need,princess. Bart already kicked me out.

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,960
- I'm moving back to my suite.  -I love you,Nate Archibald.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,730
Always have,always will.

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,030
I want nothing else to do with you,Blair. It's over.

14
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,160
Jenny,if you walk away from me now,I will ruin you.

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,760
- How are you gonna do that?  - My mother's Valentino was stolen.

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,230
- Oh,my god. That's my mother's dress.  - Do you think that you can just send me off to school

17
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,230
With a plaid skirt and a metrocard,

18
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,030
- And everything will be okay?  - I'm really sorry, Chuck.

19
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,200
I know it wasn't you who sent me that stuff.

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,160
And who am I?

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,630
That's a secret I'll never tell.

22
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,630
You know you love me.

23
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,660
X.o.x.o.,gossip girl.

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,860
Captioned by closed captioning services,inc.

25
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,260
There are three things we do alone--

26
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,260
We are born,we die,

27
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,600
And if we're a high school junior headed for college,

28
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,760
We take the S.A.T.

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,760
And while the test is said to measure our best traits, 

30
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,430
Preparing for it

31
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,630
Inevitably brings out the worst...

32
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,360
humility becomes self-doubt...

34
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,230
Guess we're all in trouble,huh?

35
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,060
Striving becomes obsession.

36
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,460
"It's Tuesday on the other side of town" 

37
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,100
Some are driven to self-medication...

38
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,000
"Most would just give up for dead"

39
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,660
So I said,"Alfie,don't get so upset" 

40
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,700
We all get scared of sticking out our necks 

41
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,130
It's expected

42
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,360
While others cling to the security

43
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,330
Of being part of a group. 

44
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,530
Ooh,Ah

45
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,260
Ba,Ba,Ba

46
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,460
Ba,Ba,Sha-Doo,Be-Doo

47
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,460
Ba,Ba,Ba

48
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,630
And anyone who's used to bending the rules

49
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,630
Will find themselves breaking them.

50
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,330
Ba,ba,ba,ba,ba,sha-doo

51
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,800
Come on,come on it's time to lose control

52
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,100
Come on,come on turn off your radio

53
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,000
Come on,come on  you're gonna feel all right

54
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,200
Come on,come on  let's do the panic tonight 

55
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,830
Uhh!

56
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,460
Ugh! Dad,don't ever do that again.

57
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,460
Just doing what I was told. time's up.

58
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,030
I was instructed that whenever time was up,

59
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,200
I should share that information. Yes,but the manner in which you went about it...it was like

60
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,960
- You were deliberately trying to humiliate me.  - How about?

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,200
Uh... half. I finished exactly half in the allowed time.

62
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,330
- Well,you're a smart kid.  - I'm a choker. I choke.

63
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,330
Mm,just in your head. T-ball. First grade. Remember this?

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,700
Bases loaded, and I stuck out. You were 6.

65
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,960
The ball was on a tee,not moving. You'll come through.

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,760
You're basing that on what,exactly?

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,760
Blind faith?

68
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,100
- Bye.  -Wait.

69
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,100
- Dad,I'm gonna be late.  - I'm coming with you.

70
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,930
- What? You're walking me to school?  - Ineed the exercise.

71
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,200
I made one mistake. It doesn't mean I need

72
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,000
- A human ankle monitor.  - You used to beg me to walk you to school.

73
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,860
- You'd cry if I didn't walk you to class.  - That wasn't me. that was Dan.

74
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,760
It's true,but I was 6,

75
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,530
And it an emotional time for me. It was post-t-ball. Jenny,what you did was wrong

76
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,030
And really out of character.

77
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,200
Grounding you is not just about punishment.

78
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,200
- We need to spend some time together, reconnect.  - Yeah, I want that,too.

79
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,660
Just... not in public and in front of my friends.

80
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,460
All right. Tonight. Dinner.

81
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,130
Okay. And I have group rehearsal.

82
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,130
- I'm the alto.  - And I'm really proud,

83
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,130
But we are connecting this evening over Lasagna.

84
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,560
Hey,Jen,you wanna wait up for a second? we could take the...

85
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,530
Well,A-All right,I'll see ya at school.

88
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,460
2200. Fair.

89
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,630
It's 90th percentile.

90
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,630
Which means Nelly Yuki probably got 2300.

91
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,630
And you don't even talk to her. why do you care how she does?

92
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,630
Nelly Yuki has her sights set on Yale,too.

93
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,130
What are the odds

94
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,300
Of them accepting two girls from constance?

95
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,300
And have you seen Nelly Yuki's extracurriculars?

96
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,500
I need to kick her well-rounded ass.

97
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,960
And they say you've lost your edge. Nelly Yuki must be destroyed.

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,130
- Why do you keep saying her name?  - Because it's Nelly Yuki.

99
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,130
Ew,gross. Incoming--chuck. You ready?

100
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,130
No,I gotta wait for Dan. He's pretty stressed.

101
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,130
He doesn't do well with tests,so... performance anxiety?

102
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,800
Bye,Blair.

103
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,460
She really needs to tone down on the social niceties.

104
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,460
It's embarrassing. Eventually,the two of you

105
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,600
- Are gonna have to work out your issues.  - What issues? I'm issue-free.

106
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,000
And,uh,based on my exhaustive research,

107
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,500
So are you.

108
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,330
Georgina?

109
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,330
According to my very reliable sources,

110
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,760
Georgina Sparks is nowhere near our fair isle.

111
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,060
She's in switzerland,dating the prince of Belfort.

112
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,060
There's a prince of Belfort? uh-huh.

113
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,660
And she's dating him? oh,thank God.

114
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,660
Now you can enjoy the gifts she mailed you

115
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,730
With peace of mind... and maybe Chuck in the room.

116
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,260
Oh,shoot. Except we're siblings.

117
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,600
Georgie always brought out the devil in you.

118
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,960
Part of me is a little disappointed she's not here.

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,830
Mm,I wonder which part. It's been a while since I saw the old Serena.

120
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,360
Well,thanks to her,

121
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,360
The new one has to break 2000 on her S.A.T.s.

122
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,960
So if you could just go smarm elsewhere...

123
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,630
The offer still stands. I know a,uh,lovely little redhead

124
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,630
That's just dying to be you for the day. Oh,I'll leave the cheating to you,Chuck.

125
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,030
I plan on taking the S.A.T.s myself.

126
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,830
You have no idea how lucky you are.

127
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,330
Seriously,Jenny.

128
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,330
I would do anything to be a freshman again. Junior year sucks.

129
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,830
Nate doesn't call. I'm not ready for the s.a.t.s. Maybe I should join Kati on the Kibbutz in Israel,

130
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,330
- Quit now.  - You guys,it's just a test.

131
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,830
Look,cram session tonight. My dad's making lasagna.

132
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,830
My brother's got tons of flash cards,

133
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,830
And I'm totally available to help.

134
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,860
That won't be necessary,little J.

135
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,000
You girls are all taken care of,

Courtesy of Blair Waldorf S.A.T. prep and spa.

137
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,030
Are you serious? If you're gonna sweat the test,it better not clog your pores.

138
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,730
This evening at my penthouse,you'll find personal tutors,

139
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,460
Hot stone massages,mani-pedis and an amazing acupuncturist

140
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,560
Who specializes in mental acuity.

141
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,730
Guess that beats my dad's lasagna. I'll flickr over some photos for you.

142
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,500
Oh,it's upperclassmen only. I'm sure you understand.

143
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,330
Totally.

144
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,630
Wait up,B.

145
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,660
I'm so glad I didn't book that flight to tel Aviv.

146
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,060
Spotted in the halls of constance--little j. realizing

147
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,260
That age really does come before beauty.

148
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,330
S.a.t.s?

149
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,330
Yeah. yeah,and,uh,soccer?

150
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,830
Why not give the old ball a kick?

151
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,330
Season's just around the corner... in October.

152
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,330
No,no,you know what? I have to stop doing that.

153
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,330
I'll just focus on myself and my--my test and my prep.

154
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,330
What other people do or don't do is about them,absolutely.

155
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,500
Not a good tester,huh?

156
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,500
Oh,Chuck,I had no idea you felt that way about me.

157
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,530
Good to know you're at least still kind of funny.

158
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,030
Hey,I'm so sorry.

159
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,030
I've been completely off the radar the past few days.

160
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,030
New home,new family. It's okay.

161
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,030
Yeah,it's,um,pretty overwhelming.

162
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,530
Yeah,I...I've been a little overwhelmed myself lately.

163
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,530
Well,you wanna hang out... Study?

164
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,030
Mmm. ooh. I wanna take whatever s.a.t. prep course

165
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,530
You're signed up for.

166
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,030
Well,it's not too late.

167
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,030
Okay. I'm in,then.

168
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,100
I'll see you.

169
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,900
You always did know how to leave them wanting more.

170
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,160
Oh,my god,Georgina.

171
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,760
- What are you doing here?  - Well,I told you I was coming.

172
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,700
Didn't you get my gifts?  - Uh,you're supposed to be in switzerland dating a prince.

173
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,830
Luckily daddy didn't need the g5.

174
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,860
Haven't you missed me?

175
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,530
How could I not?

176
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,530
Okay. You don't want to throw me a homecoming party.

177
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,030
I get it,but let's have a cocktail,

178
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,500
Catch up.

179
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:52,200
S.,you're really gonna hurt my feelings,

180
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,130
And you know how I get when my feelings are hurt.

181
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,160
Great. I'll see you tonight.

182
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,100
It's so weird seeing you. It's almost like i never left.

183
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,500
Spotted in the courtyard--

184
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,000
Serena looking like she's seen a ghost--

185
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,660
The ghost of parties past.

186
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,860
- Jenny,why did you want to meet here?  - Well,I've been thinking--

187
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,860
What's the one thing that no one in our group has,

188
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,860
I mean,not even Blair?  - Compassion?

189
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,860
No,a boyfriend. you know,if I'm gonna make it to queen,

190
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,060
I need a king. Queen Elizabeth never had a boyfriend.

191
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,660
But she only had the spanish to conquer,

192
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,200
And I have Blair Waldorf. Let's talk qualifications.

193
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,560
He has to be cute,but not fool of himself.

194
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,000
He has to be from the right kind of family...

195
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,600
Ugh,but not disgusting. 

196
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,200
Come on. 

197
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,500
Whoa!

198
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,100
Oh,oh,aw...

199
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,060
I'm so sorry. are you okay?

200
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,900
Yeah,uh,my lunch isn't,though.

201
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:05,900
Oh,Linus.

202
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,730
Let me give you... my last dollar.

203
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,730
Oh,I couldn't.

204
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,260
You shouldn't be walking the streets with no money.

205
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,600
Let's just settle for an i.o.u. then.

206
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,600
It's just a hot dog.

207
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,430
That was just my excuse to give this to you.

208
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,130
Here's my number.

209
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,760
Thank you.

210
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,260
I mean,it's fine.

211
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,760
I mean,I'm really not even that hungry.

212
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,960
Well,if you change your mind...

213
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,330
What are you doing? He's gorgeous.

214
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,830
He's a dog walker.

215
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,330
I need a king,not a jester.

216
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,900
Come on. Let's go lurk outside dalton.

217
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,560
- Hey.  - Vanessa.

218
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,330
You're nate,right? You play a very small but crucial role

219
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,300
In my video project.  - Oh,that's right.

220
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,630
I remember you following Dan around with your video camera.  - Hey,Nate.

221
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,460
What are you doing here? I mean,I know the coffee's good...

222
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Since I've taken every s.a.t. prep and review class

223
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,960
In the five boroughs,I figured why not pay it forward? So--so you don't need these?

224
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,730
You know,I've actually already taken it.

225
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,730
My parents don't want me going to u.s.c.,

226
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,160
So I had to make sure my scores were good enough

227
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,800
To get in without their help,which,thanks to these books,

228
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,800
They were,so i'm done.   - While we all love hearing about the struggles of the idle rich,

229
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,800
Dan's got a fine tutor right here.

230
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,130
I ace every practice test i take,

231
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,600
- So we don't need your hand-me-downs.   - Um,you know what? th-this is actually pretty good.

232
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,930
- This looks good. thank you.  - Is there a reason you insist

233
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,160
On looking so desperate and needy?   - She's been like that since we were kids--

234
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Venomous without provocation. It's better than being a charity case.

235
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,830
She's rude,too. I see that.

236
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,630
Yeah. Well,i gotta get going,

237
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,260
But i hope these are useful.

238
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,760
Oh,yeah,yeah,very. Thank you. 

239
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,260
What?

240
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,860
They're--hey,every little bit helps.

243
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,500
Is this really the best place for us to talk?

244
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,500
You of all people know

245
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,700
Nothing gets me talking like a cosmo.

247
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,230
A lot has changed since we used to hang out,Georgie.

248
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,260
- I know. I get it.   - No,you don't get it,or you wouldn't have sent me

249
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,600
All those so-called gifts in the first place.

250
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,160
Oh,come on,sweetie. Those were funny.

251
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,760
Get over yourself. I was just trying to make you laugh.

252
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,660
How about this-- How about for one night,

253
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,430
We hang out like old times,but unlike old times,

254
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,260
I won't get out of control,unless you want me to.

255
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,030
I mean,i can totally get out--

256
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,700
No,okay. I-i won't get out of control,

257
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,700
And i totally respect that.

258
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,500
Please stop me any time you feel like answering.

259
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,230
Any... time. come on.

261
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,860
One drink,but only one.

262
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,930
Cheers.

264
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,600
Where are all the tutors?

265
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,600
- And the masseuses?  - And the smoothies?

266
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,060
All that i have promised you is waiting.

267
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,230
And while it gives me great pleasure

268
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,630
To think of us crossing that s.a.t. finish line together,

269
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,460
Before the race can begin,

270
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,100
You need to be made aware of one little thing.

271
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,100
Nelly Yuki,top in our class,

272
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,300
Summer schooled at the Sorbonne.

273
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,330
Lots of people do summer at Sorbonne,including me.

274
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,830
True. Penelope,you may be a national merit scholar,

275
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,230
But Nelly Yuki is a merit scholar...

276
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,400
A Peabody scholar

277
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,800
And an intel science talent search finalist.

278
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,600
Isabel,you're a concert pianist,

279
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,630
But Itzhak Perlman himself gave Nelly her very first violin.

280
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,400
Hazel...

281
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,500
You're just along for the ride,'kay?

282
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,800
But if any of us wants to live out our college dreams,

283
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,300
We have to find Nelly Yuki's weakness

284
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,800
And exploit it.

285
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:08,000
So what's it gonna be-- aromatherapy or annihilation?

286
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,330
What's the plan?

289
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,130
It was,like,the worst thing ever,

290
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,130
And then--and then,do you remember?

291
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,030
Do you remember when we ran out of money?

292
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,630
And then i had to flash the bartender

293
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,630
'Cause we ran out of money. Wait,wait. Oh,my god.

294
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,260
Remember when we were Savannah and Svetlana?  - Oh,Savannah.

295
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,760
Savannah!

296
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,960
I totally forgot about Savannah and Svetlana. Svetlana.

297
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,030
Wait,no,I think we were Tiffany and Angel that night.

299
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,630
Oh,you could talk me into anything.

300
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,530
Hey,ladies,can i,uh,get you guys another round?

301
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,130
- Ooh.  - No,thank you.

302
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,660
Hmm. Oh.

303
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,660
My american girlfriend,

304
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,730
So uptight.

305
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,230
They think the drink lead to the sex.

306
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,500
No,no,no,I wasn't being rude.

307
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,200
I just didn't want to take anything

308
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,230
If I couldn't offer anything in return.

309
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,230
We'd be happy with just one dance.

310
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,060
Aw. Aw. I'm afraid i have two left feet.

311
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,060
Aw,this is what is the practice for. Come on,lady.

312
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,700
Opa!

314
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,400
Who is that?

315
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,860
Um,no one. uh,thank you for calling back.

316
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,560
Ahh! Nadine the beauty queen. How can i help you?

317
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,560
I don't have time for this.

318
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,560
Do you want 1 or 2 g's?

319
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,830
Can you just give it-- some dealer you know?

320
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,760
I didn't realize i brought my grandmother.

321
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,730
I have to go.

323
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,360
Hey,come here.

324
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,660
Whoo!

325
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,160
I'm so stupid,so,so,so,so stupid.

326
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
You don't sound stupid. You sound drunk.

327
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,200
What have you been into?

328
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,700
Georgina.

329
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,700
Good news is,she doesn't want anything except to party.

330
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,200
Bad news is,I partied.

331
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,360
Care to paint a picture? Does this party require clothes?

332
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,860
I'm supposed to be at Dan's studying.

333
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,860
I called to tell him I'd be late,

334
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,200
But not this late. I...I just have to call him and say...

335
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,200
That instead of studying with him,

336
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,200
You're out with your old pal Georgina.

337
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,560
No. I don't want him to know she exists.

338
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,060
My mom,Blair,even you can't stand her.

339
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,560
Dan of all people cannot know Georgie.

340
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,160
Can you help me?

341
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,760
Say you need me.

342
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,060
Chuck!

343
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,560
Hearing you scream my name is more than enough.

344
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,760
I'll take care of it and pick you up in ten.

346
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,400
Hey,I've been wondering where you were. You mean all of your life?

347
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,900
Uh,don't take this the wrong way,Serena,

348
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,930
But you sound just like this jackass we know. Serena has food poisoning.

349
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,130
She's too sick to come to your playdate. Put her on the phone.

350
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,660
The bathroom doesn't get reception.

351
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,660
Somehow I don't believe you. And I'd like to say I'm a little glad about that,

352
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,930
But my poor,sick sister has asked for my assistance

353
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,430
In the matter,so I'll leave it at this...

354
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,500
She's not coming. Don't try calling.

355
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,130
Humphrey,always a pleasure.

358
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,760
I'm gonna have to call you back. Hey.

359
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,630
Beautiful day you're ruining,isn't it? Do me a favor,please,and leave Serena alone.

360
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,700
It was Serena I was doing a favor 

361
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,700
All i know is before spring break,

362
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,230
Everything was great. It was good.

363
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,530
Now break's over,she's not quite herself,

364
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,530
And I'm...I'm trying to think,what has changed in her life? 

365
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,530
Oh,the Bass family moved into it.

366
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,030
Dan,hi.

367
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,030
Hey. hey,how you feeling?

368
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,360
Good. my Migraine's gone.

369
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,060
Migraine? I thought you had food poisoning.

370
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,700
Yeah,that came after.

371
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,360
What exactly happened last night?

372
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,900
I already told him.

373
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,630
I'm asking 

374
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,830
Well,I got food poisoning,and then Chuck helped me out.

375
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,730
Okay,where exactly did you eat

376
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,730
That you got this killer food poisoning Migraine? Can we drop the interrogation?

377
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,730
As soon as you tell me where my girlfriend is. I'm right here with you.

379
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,330
Look,I...I gotta go to class.

380
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,830
I can't... I can't do this.

381
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,730
This is exactly why I didn't want her to come back.

382
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,730
She's been back a day already and look what's happening.

383
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
If it's really that bad,

384
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,260
Why don't you just tell him about her?

385
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,260
I can't. I'll see you later.

386
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,260
Look,I'm not stupid.

387
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,260
I know you're not really interested

388
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,260
In how my family owns half of tribeca. of course we're interested.

389
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,000
You're the newest member of our little club. Which is only for the smartest girls of the junior class.

390
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,160
Our junior class only has 30 girls.

391
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,430
We're already an elite club. Can I go now?

392
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,100
You what would be hot? you,us at G Spa. I don't drink.

393
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,200
Saks fifth? hate shopping.

394
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,860
Yogurt on the steps? lactose-intolerant. Look,I really don't want any friends.

395
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,530
All I want is to be alone

396
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,900
And to listen to Florida ever again. What happened? A little backstage hit it and quit it?

397
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,730
What? No,my boyfriend broke up with me at a Florida Concert.

398
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,630
One minute we were waving our hands in the air

399
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,160
Like we just didn't care,and the next...

401
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,860
Since the dalton guys were a bust,

402
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,360
How about collegiate?

403
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,300
The boys' lacrosse team is working out just around...

404
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,300
Jenny,look.

405
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,230
What did I tell you about that dog walker?

406
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,260
There are no kings on Craigslist.

407
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,030
But I don't think he's the walker.

408
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,500
I think he's the owner.

410
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,860
I spy my king.

412
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,700
Hi. How have you been?

419
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,130
Oh,god. Not that song.

420
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,630
Nelly Yuki,what's wrong? It's like it's happening all over again.

421
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,800
That song just reminds me of my boyfriend...

422
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,300
My ex-boyfriend,I should say.

423
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,030
Oh,no. Did he dump you?  That's horrible.

424
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,300
W...w...what was his name? Brad? Bill?

425
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,560
Todd... Jansen.

426
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,560
There's nothing like the fresh,sharp pain of a breakup.

427
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,060
Believe me,I've had my fair share of heartache,

428
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,100
But this is about you.

429
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,960
Tonight you're gonna come over to my house,

430
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,760
And just cry till you get it all out of your system. I can't. I have to be focused tomorrow.

431
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,800
You can't focus when something's on your mind,

432
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,300
Now can you? come,come,come. Tell me all about it.

433
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,179
I guess I'll just take the check,please. Okay.

435
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:10,629
Hey, hold that, will ya?

438
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,800
Daylight Savings moved to March. Maybe no one told you. I know I'm late.

440
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,080
Coffee, Nate?

442
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Yeah,thanks,Cora.

444
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,900
You two know each other? I've been here before.

446
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,530
Are you telling me you come all the way to Brookn

448
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,579
For greek food? Well,when I'm Brooklyn,I like to come here,yes.

450
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,179
'Cause you're in Brooklyn all the time.

452
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,989
Well,my...my father's in rehab a couple blocks away,

454
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,829
And,uh,which,by the way, is why I'm late. I was...

456
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,530
Visiting hours... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

458
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,940
No. I mean, it's not like it's some big secret.

459
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,570
It was on the front page of every newspaper in the city.

460
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,470
I guess it was, yeah.

461
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,860
Sometimes after I'm done seeing him,

462
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,550
I'm not ready to go back and see my mom just yet,

463
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,990
So I come here and I sit and just, uh...

464
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,780
Think about how hard it is

465
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,500
To know whose side you're supposed to be on,

466
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,790
Mom versus dad, kid in the middle?

467
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:07,640
Confession... I read one of your practice essays.

468
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,740
You left it in a book that you gave dan,

469
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,750
And that's why I called you... to apologize.

470
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,710
Why?

471
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,700
Because... I judged the cover,

472
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,710
But now that I've read the book,

473
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,490
I figured you were owed some apologetic souvlaki,

474
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,910
At the very least.

475
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,780
Hey, Georgie. It was good to see you last night.

476
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,110
When did you say you were going back to Belgium?

477
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,400
Uh, Switzerland, actually,

478
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,060
And I'm supposed to leave tomorrow,

479
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,190
But I'm not going until I get a chance

480
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:50,340
To make it up to you first. Oh, nothing to make up. I had fun.

481
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,650
No, you didn't. I mean, until after you left,

482
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,710
I don't think I really heard what you were saying.

483
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:59,430
I-I didn't get it. You've really changed.

484
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,210
Yeah, I have.

485
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,400
I don't mean to sound corny,

486
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,320
But... it's a real inspiration to me.

487
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,090
Really?

488
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,560
I mean, look, I've always thought

489
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,850
That i am who I'm going to be for the rest of my life,

490
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:15,360
And even those times when I maybe don't like myself,

491
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:20,110
Well... you can't decide to be somebody else.

492
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,050
No, you can. yeah, listen, let's have dinner.

493
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,810
I-I mean, I want to hear about your life,

494
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:29,400
And if you can change, maybe there's hope for me, too.

495
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,690
No, i-i have to study. I have S.A.Ts in the morning.

496
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,910
It'll just be an hour. We can time it. I promise.

497
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,270
The hardest drug on the table will be... Perrier.

498
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,440
Spotted...Serena Van Der Woodsen

499
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,390
Being given a real life multiple choice question

500
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,680
"A"--go home and study,

501
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,080
"B"--get a good night's sleep,

502
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,710
"C"--call your boyfriend

503
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,430
Or "D"...

504
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,460
An hour.

505
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,940none of the above.
None of the above

506
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:58,990
Good.

507
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,030
Hope that wasn't the wrong answer, S.

508
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,170
This test doesn't grade on a curve.

509
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,020
All right, "capacious"--

510
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,250
Looks like "spacious. What does it mean? Roomy.

511
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,040
Oh, yeah.

512
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,850
"Captious."

513
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,970
Looks like...

514
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,220
That looks like"capacious."

515
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,590
Oh. I can't concentrate.

516
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,090
Sound of your own voice distracting you?

517
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,730
No. it's, uh, Serena, actually.

518
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,999
We had an argument.

519
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,890
I'm home!

520
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:27,530
Oh!

521
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,890
Look it. Trig identities are memorized,

522
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,389
My latin is resurrected, and my lit paper's finished.

523
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,620
Impressive.

524
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,560
Seeing as you've returned the valentino,

525
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,810
And you've logged ten hours of volunteer work

526
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,820
With Betty at the shop...

527
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,100
- I'm not grounded anymore?  I have something for you.

528
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,770
No way!

529
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,520
- Oh!  - It's not exactly the same as the one you pawned,

530
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,850
But...

531
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,680
Thank you, dad!

532
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,120
You know, Jen, no one's happier than me to see this.

533
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,000
Do you know how much it costs to get a zipper repaired?

534
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:04,010
- Yeah, I figured since you'd be spending so much time at home  - Wait. What?

535
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,520
- So I guess you're still grounded.  - Dan.

536
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,570
- Dad, wait.  - I met this really nice guy,

537
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,670
And I'm supposed to meet him in the park for lunch tomorrow.  - Well, grounded or not grounded,

538
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,820
- You're not old enough to date.  - It's not a date. He's just a friend.

539
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,250
- Who is this guy?  - You don't know him. He goes to unity.

540
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,380
- Wait, upper east side unity?  - Technically, that's upper west side, dad.

541
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
- How are you helping?  - I thought you wanted to take a break from that whole crowd.

542
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:25,440
- What "whole crowd"?  - The one that made you feel like compromising your character

543
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,100
Was a prerequisite to hanging out with them.  - So it's okay for dan to date someone rich, though?

544
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,930
Well, it's not without its complications. Believe me.

545
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,530
I thought you said it wasn't a date.

546
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,120
It was nice there for a minute.  - It was.

547
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,940
Hey, S.

548
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,780
I'm just sipping a gingko biloba blended

549
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,070
And wondering how your stomach migraine is.

550
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,560
Call me so i don't worry.

551
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,120
How you doing, Nelly Yuki?

552
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,780
My upper trapezius seems to hold a lot of sadness.

553
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,160
Something tells me you'll be feeling better very soon...

554
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,410
Any minute.

555
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,540
No. I think I should just go home and study.

556
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,950
Uh, Mr. Jansen is here to see Miss Yuki.

557
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,600
Todd's here?

558
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,630
Do I have cushion face?

559
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:22,830
A little.

560
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,540
Hello, Todd.

561
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,790
Hi, Nelly. Blair said it was all right if I came.

562
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,270
For a siberian ginseng pedi?

563
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:36,970
No.

564
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,030
I really feel bad about how things ended, Nell.

565
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,270
So do I.

566
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,560
- Can we talk about it? In private?  - Okay.

567
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,090
Thank you, B.

568
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,240
Lucky for us,

569
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,570
Mental acuity and common sense rarely come in the same package.

570
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,570
Oxygen facials, anyone?

571
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,090
Next time your sister's band is in town,

572
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,540
I want front row seats.

573
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,690
You don't strike me as a lesbian punk fan.

574
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,450
You know, I am almost offended by how much

575
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,020
You underestimate me, Ms. Abrams.

576
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,160
- You like punk?  - Oh, I didn't hear you s--you said "punk"?

577
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,720
Cause you had me at "lesbian."

578
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,520
Oh, right. Didn't see that one coming.

579
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,670
- Hey, tell me something.  - Yes?

580
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,020
Why do you do S.A.T. practice tests

581
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,450
If you're not planning on taking the exam?

582
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,830
To help dan study.

583
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,280
I'm a filmmaker. Best education for me is making films.

584
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,920
I can't never met anyone

585
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,470
Who thought college was optional.

586
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,700
My parents are artists. My sister's a musician.

587
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,240
Just like going to an ivy is your family's way,

588
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,790
Not going to college is mine.

589
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,530
Think your parents want to adopt a 17 year old?

590
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,020
Maybe?

591
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,140
So...

592
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,430
So...

593
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,340
I guess this is good night, then?

594
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,600
I don't live here, you know.

595
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:10,740
No, I know.

596
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,500
I'm just grabbing my laptop.

597
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,930
Do you want to come inside?

598
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,950
God. It does feel like that doorstep moment.

599
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,630
And what moment would that be?

600
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,080
Yeah. that's the moment.

601
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,530
Can I get you two a cocktail?

602
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,350
Oh. I'm fine with my diet coke. Thank you.

603
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,470
Um, yeah, me, too. Thanks.

604
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,440
So... tell me about dan.

605
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,300
I did. Oh, come on.

606
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:10,470
His last name and his zip code? Scintillating details.

607
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,630
Come on. He's part of Serena second edition.

608
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,750
Well...

609
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,640
I-I like the way I feel when he looks at me.

610
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,220
How?

611
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,350
Like...

612
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,170
like I wanna believe in myself.

613
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,190
I-I know.

614
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,690
You think it's a clich?

615
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,010
Uh, no. no, sweetie. I-I-I think it's...

616
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,690
It's incredible.

617
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,480
Yeah.

618
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,850
Look...I know I may not be

619
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,350
Your most trusted friend right now,

620
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,210
But I think I know the old you pretty well.

621
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,350
Yeah, better than, um, anyone, actually.

622
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,220
Well, from where I sit, it would take...

623
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,070
A lot to bring that person back.

624
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,960
Um... I'm gonna call him, actually.

625
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,450
He's pretty nervous about tomorrow,

626
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,350
So I wanna wish him luck. So I'll be back.

627
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,490
- That was quick.  - Yeah, he didn't pick up.

628
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,720
- Oh, you can try him again later.  - Yeah.

629
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,620
- Okay, I'd like to propose a toast.  - Okay.

630
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,120
To the new you.

631
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,470
To the new me.

632
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,060
Cheers.

633
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,280
Ooh. You don't look so good.

634
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,380
You okay, S?

635
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,460
No, I'm not okay.

636
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,180
Wait, how did we get here? What are we doing here?

637
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,430
Oh, my god. I'm supposed to be at Hunter college.

638
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,140
If memory serves, and it usually does,

639
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:30,180
- They don't let you in if you're late.  - Oh, my god.

640
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:31,980
I'm thinking eggs.

641
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:37,050
Do you want...florentine or benedict?

642
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,110
Wait. I was drinking soda, Georgie.

643
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,930
Yeah, until you switched to patron

644
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,020
Look, don't worry. I called Lily and covered your ass.

645
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,510
So... you're welcome.

646
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,630
No, you--you knew I had S.A.T this morning.

647
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,770
Which is why I brought you here

648
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,340
Instead of letting you go home with one of your many suitors.

649
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,210
You know the guy with the ironic mustache?

650
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,890
You two took over the deejay booth.  - Wait, a mustache? what are you talking about?

651
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,730
I guess you haven't changed as much as you thought.

652
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,280
Chuck? Chuck, hey. I'm in trouble.

653
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,240
Look, I think I can still make it,

654
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,880
But please go to hunter,

655
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,950
Try to keep the doors open until I get there.

656
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,380
Hey!

657
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,150
Last night was strange, but very fun.

658
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,800
Like...we said goodbye five hours ago?

659
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,030
I'm taking you somewhere. I'm going somewhere--to work.

660
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,400
- Get someone to cover for you.  - I can't just jump in the car with you

661
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,230
- Because you decide to show up.  - Well, I'm not asking you to.

662
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,490
This is a onetime offer, and there's a clock ticking.

663
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,780
But...

664
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,680
Fine. I am intrigued.

665
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,060
You wish your brother good luck today?

666
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:11,980
Yeah.

667
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,300
May I be excused?

668
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,200
No, you may not.

669
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,190
And we are not gonna walk around this house all day

670
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,380
And not talk to each other.

671
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:28,260
Fine. You want me to speak?I'll speak.

672
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,410
You've completely and entirely prejudged the upper east side.

673
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,890
Maybe you shouldn't speak.dad, I learned my lesson on my birthday.

674
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,780
Asher's not like those girls.He's different.

675
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,840
I mean, he's nice and polite and he likes animals.

676
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,170
Please let me go today?

677
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,300
So you didn't cancel?

678
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,300
I thought you'd change your mind.

679
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:51,950
I haven't.

680
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,660
Nate, I don't know about this.

681
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,250
I can't.I didn't even study.

682
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:09,300
Yeah, and you still made great scores

683
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,450
On your practice tests.

684
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,600
That was for fun.

685
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,750
Listen, there's nothing wrong with keeping your options open.

686
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,490
I don't think your parents are gonna be mad at you

687
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,760
For choosing your own path...

688
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,870
Unless they're related to my parents.

689
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,480
Okay. Right now I'm going inside,

690
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,080
And I'm not looking back, or I might change my mind.

691
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,010
...Do really well.What?

692
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,890
Rough night?

693
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,970
Yeah,and not in a good way.

694
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,810
Todd doesn't wanna get back together.no?

695
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,250
But he said...

696
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,170
We stayed up all night having the same conversation

697
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:01,300
About why we broke up over and over again. Unbelievable.I can't believe it. crazy.

698
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,790
I got no sleep,spent the whole night crying.

699
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,420
Okay. Well, good luck.

700
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,350
Do you really think this is gonna work?

701
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:17,110
Yes, but I also believe in insurance.

702
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,690
From her calculator.

703
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,260
You never did tell us how you got todd to play along.

704
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,620
Isabel, what are you doing later tonight?

705
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,710
Uh, not todd.okay, well,

706
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,320
I guess I'm gonna have to come up with something else.

707
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,270
Dan... where's Serena?

708
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,580
Uh, I don't know,but I bet Chuck does.

709
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:40,120
Ugh. well, I'll try to save a seat for her.yeah, I'll--I'll keep calling.

710
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,130
Hey, Serena, it's me--a-a very worried me

711
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,830
Concerned about a very missing you.

712
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,640
Hi.I'm Serena Van Der Woodsen.

713
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,920
How'd you do?

714
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,860
Uh, not my finest hour.

715
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,570
I finished, but... I kinda had a lot on my mind.

716
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,870
I'll keep calling.

717
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,290
Yeah. I think I know where to find her.

718
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,740
Hey, S. it's B.

719
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,220
Now I'm really worried.

720
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,859
I'm gonna go home and change,

721
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,820
And then...

722
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,950
Call me. bye.

723
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:53,880
Hey.

724
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,020
Hey.

725
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,830
What's going on?

726
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,030
Um... nothing. I'm fine.

727
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,100
No, you're not, and you need to stop saying that.

728
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,970
Hey. Come here.

729
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:07,970
Where were you?

730
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,170
She was with me.

731
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,760
What he means is, we were both at home.

732
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:18,270
Um, my stomach started acting up again.oh, okay.A food poisoning relapse?

733
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,840
Look, if--if--if you didn't study enough

734
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,120
And you're freaked out,I can--I told you. I was sick.

735
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,740
You paid someone else to take the s.a.t. for you,

736
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,760
And that's the best you can do? What are you talking about?

737
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,850
I'm talking about the 5-foot-nothing redhead

738
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,420
Claiming to be Serena Van Der Woodsen.

739
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,160
I'm--I'm pretty sure that wasn't you.Chuck, what did you do? I told you to keep the doors open.

740
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,520
When I got there,they were closed.yeah, they don'tkeep the doors open.

741
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,430
I was thinking on my feet,just trying to help.

742
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,340
I'm not mad.okay, I'm just worried.

743
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,390
I've been so worried about you.

744
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,370
Please, help me understand what's going on here.

745
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,530
Can we talk tomorrow?

746
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,120
I'll call you.

747
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:04,160
I'm sorry.

748
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,670
I'm sorry, too.

749
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,590
Chuck, you went too far.

750
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,600
And so did you, sis.

751
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,870
Look, I feel foolish for admitting it,

752
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,500
But obviously,I've come late to this party.

753
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,770
English, please.

754
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,630
What's Georgina got on you?Chuck...

755
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:41,740
Dan I understand, but what's so bad you can't even tell me?

756
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,540
Oh, hi, sweetie.

757
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,920
Let me just, uh,call some room service--

758
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,480
I don't want you to ever contact me again.

759
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,480
Just because of a few nights of harmless fun?

760
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,880
It wasn't fun waking up and not knowing where I was,

761
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,250
It wasn't fun missing the s.a.t.s,

762
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,930
And it definitely wasn't fun lying to dan.

763
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,750
And this is all my fault because...

764
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:16,670
It's my fault,

765
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,310
Because I make huge mistakeswhen I'm with you.

766
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,570
So you want to distance yourself from your "mistakes"

767
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:23,830
By staying away from me?

768
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,670
You were there, too, Serena.

769
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,110
It was just as much you,if not more--this is not about last year. It's about last night.

770
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,980
Like you were just some innocent bystander

771
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,520
Who walked in on--I'm not talking about it,Georgina! okay?

772
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,820
And neither are you.

773
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,220
If I go down,

774
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,590
You go down with me.

775
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,250
In the meantime,

776
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,110
Stay out of my life.

777
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,860
I don't need anybody in my lifewho doesn't want to be there.

778
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:54,870
Then we're agreed.

779
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,010
You must be the unity boy.

780
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,070
Uh, hopefully, there's not another one on his way.

781
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,770
Name's asher,and I do go to unity.

782
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,270
Hi.

783
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,780
Asher?

784
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,550
What are you doing here?

785
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,800
I was just gonna ask the same thing.

786
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,670
Uh, since you couldn't come to the hot dogs,

787
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,850
I'm bringing them to you.

788
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,890
Sorry to s-surprise you, sir.

789
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,220
That's so sweet,especially since

790
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,630
My unreasonable father has grounded me for life.

791
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,910
I'm standing right here.

792
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,990
I wish more of my friends' parents

793
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,020
Cared enough to ground them when they messed up.

794
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,650
Looks like our queen wannabe found her perfect king.

795
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,990
Well, since you're here...

796
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,530
With a year's supply of hot dogs,

797
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,210
Maybe you'd like to come in.

798
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,640
We hear he's a unity man.

799
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,430
Guess big brother's been teaching little sis

800
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,800
How to snag the ones with a trust fund.

801
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,790
Hi. 

802
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,300
Oh!

803
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,510
Hey, buddy, there you go.

804
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,050
Aw! Georgie, hey!

805
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,650
Bad boy.

806
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,260
Sorry he disturbed you.

807
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,210
Uh, it's fine.I love dogs.

808
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:36,340
Really? Do you have any? No. uh, we used to have a cat,

809
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,690
But, you know...sister... allergies.

810
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,490
Now the cat--iggy--lives in florida with my grandma.

811
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,570
I... he doesn't write. He never calls.

812
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:46,910
I'm sorry to hear that.

813
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,890
It's just a cat.

814
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,490
Um. I'm sarah, by the way.

815
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,030
I'm dan. nice to meet you, Sarah.
