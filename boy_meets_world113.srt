No.

oh.

00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:27,218
Actually it isn't a rose.
It's a camellia.

7
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,230
In the language
of flowers...

8
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:34,234
a white camellia means
perfect loveliness.

The person
who left this for me...

The only time I've ever
seen a look like that...

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,489
was just before Bambi's
mother caught that bullet.

This morning we have
a guest lecturer.

that since you're all starting
the seventh grade next year...

38
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,399
it would behoove you...

39

good students.

00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,637
into a big city.

183
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,977
It's just a bigger school.

184
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,642
How easy is it to get drugs?

185
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,672
I don't do drugs.

186
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:05,776
But if you wanted to?

187
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,786
Pretty easy.

188
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,788
-Alcohol?
-Easier.

189
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:09,811
Cigarettes?

190
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:10,914
oh, come on, Mr. Feeny.
I didn't want...

191
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,356
to bring them down
with stuff like that.

192
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:15,418
I mean I wanted to give them
something to look forward to.

193
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,987
Mr. Matthews, do you
consider yourself popular...

194
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,261
an influential voice
in high school?

195
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,734
Look, Mr. Feeny,
I'm no role model.

196
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:26,068
Yes, but the moment you
stepped into that classroom...

197
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,937
you became one.

198
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,579
That Was the Worst
macaroni and cheese...

199
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,022
I've ever tasted.

200
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:47,049
You going to finish yours?

201
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,529
You're a pig,
you know that?

202
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,428
Hey, I'm in a growth
spurt. I need fuel.

203
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,932
Yeah, well, those of us

who sit near you...

204
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,730
don't like
the exhaust fumes.

205
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,594
oh, look.

206
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,471
Here comes the future
Mrs. Cory Matthews.

207
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,566
Hello, Cory.

208
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,474
Cory's not here.

209
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,978
My sister rented
a videotape...

210
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,503
I thought you might
be interested in seeing.

211
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,413
He left.
You just missed him.

212
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,281
GodziLLa Goes to CoLLege.

213
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,252
Whoa.

214
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:18,087
That's the one where
Godzilla scarfs down UCLA.

215
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,148
Yeah.

216
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,853
When can we borrow it?

217
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,260
You can't.
It's my sister's tape.

218
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,287
She said I can't
let it out of my sight.

219
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,629
oK, what time should we

be over at your house?

220
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,134
our VCR is broken.

221
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,966
I'll have to bring it
to your house.

222
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,596
All right, how about 4:00?

223
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,867
4:00 is good for me.

224
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,307
That will give me time
to get home and get ready.

225
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,331
Get ready?

226
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,675
I mean get the tape.
That's all. Bye.

227
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:44,544
oh, man, she's got
a thang for you.

228
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,514
What do I care?

229
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:49,749
All I want from her
is brownies and videos.

230
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,621
You maggot.

231
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:56,688
Huh?

232
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:00,256
All these years pretending
to be my close friend.

233
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,795
Close? As in Philadelphia
is close to...Neptune?

234
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,240
All so you could get to her.

235
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,709
Her, Topanga?
I don't think so.

236
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,679
oh, please. The whole school's
talking about you two.

237
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,306
What? I ate
a couple brownies.

238
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,214
I said I'd Watch a video.

239
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:21,709
Aren't you forgetting
the trip to Acapulco?

240
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,551
What?

241
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,785
I embellished.

242
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,123
Do you really care
about her...

243
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:31,619
or are you just doing this
to humiliate me?

244
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,565
I give up.
Take it, Shawn.

245
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,068
Minkus...

246
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,071
Want to play walnut?

247
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,629
Your bodyguard
can't be with you...

248
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,574
24 hours a day, Matthews.

249
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,100
Be afraid...

250
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,444
Be very afraid.

251
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,084
I've got two words
for you...

252
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,644
Antiperspirant.

253
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,217
That's 3 Words.

254
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:03,694
What's going on here?

255
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,561
I don't want girls
to like me.

256
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:06,895
Why is everything changing?

257
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,197
Hey, Topanga
forgot her notebook.

258
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,600
Want to trash it?

259
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,537
I got a little
macaroni and cheese left.

260
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:15,234
Naw, she'll probably think
it's some type of love code.

261
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:18,540
oh, why do I have
to be so attractive?

262
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,045
oh, look.

263
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,038
It's a heart with a name
doodled in swirly things.

264
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,244
"Mrs. Matthews."

265
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,617
Give me a break.

266
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,554
"Mrs. Topanga Matthews."

267
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,056
ooh...

268
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,058
"Mrs. Eric Matthews."

269
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,560
Would you get off my--

270
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,085
What?

271
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,834
Eric, I'm glad
I caught you.

272
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:51,969
We got to talk.

273
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,706
Not now. I'm headed down
to the video arcade.

274
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,737
Play games some other time.
This is important.

275
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:57,181
Hey, this is
important, too.

276
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,653
Eric, somebody's
in love with you.

277
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,520
oh, yeah? Who?

278
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,046
Topanga Lawrence.

279
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,025
You know, that hair

in the front row...

280
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,687
with the girl attached?

281
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,889
We're talking about
a sixth grader? Later.

282
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,228
I'm telling you, Eric,
she loves you.

283
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,733
Look, she's 1 1.

She's too young...

284
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:15,825
to have feelings like that.

285
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,927
Minkus is only 1 1,
and he loves her.

286
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,064
Will you stop saying that
word? Nobody loves anybody.

287
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,131
I mean...you're babies.

288
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,301
You're too young
to understand...

289
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:26,437
the pain of love,
the agony of love...

290
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,947
the seamy underbelly of love.

291
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,643
You're not going to
fully understand it...

292
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,173
until you're...1 5.

293
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,310
Like you?

294
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:36,254
I understood it at 14,

but, hey, I was a natural.

295
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,689
Look, Eric, you got
to kiss her off.

296
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,716
Get her out of
your life and mine.

297
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,852
She's not in mine.

298
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,088
Well, she's going to be.

299
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,257
You know, it sounds

like you're jealous.

300
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,766
oh, yeah. I'm jealous.

301
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,167
That's just what I want,
to be Topanga's boyfriend...

302
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,694
and then we can
name our children...

303
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:55,299
Chewbacca and Plankton.

304
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,507
oK, I'll get rid of her.

305
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,239
What do you want me to say?

306
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,214
All right, she's coming
over in a little while.

307
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,716
Tell her that We
both think she's scum...

308
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,912
and that I'm politically
incoherent.

309
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,921
-lncorrect.
-There you go.

310
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,014
All right. I'll
let her down easy...

311
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,888
but they're usually
pretty crushed...

312
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,483
so when you hear
the doorbell...

313
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,757
call someone to pick up
the pieces, oK?

314
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,736
-Hey.
-Hey.

315
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,964
Your mom told me...

316
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,632
you're having a little
confab about a girl.

317
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:31,075
Not any normal girl,
a totally weird girl--

318
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,737
Topanga Lawrence.

319
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,009
Well, I bet most girls...

320
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,278
seem a little weird
to you at this age.

321
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,751
Come on, Dad.

You don't understand.

322
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,515
I'm not talking
"I'm a guy...

323
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,078
and I don't
understand girls."

324
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,317
I'm talking really,
truly weird.

325
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:48,054
She eats sandwiches
made out of brown rice...

326
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,324
and has a sister
named Nebula.

327
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,830
Well, what seems

to be the problem...

328
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:52,888
between you and this girl?

329
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,524
No problem.

330
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,364
See, I thought she
had a crush on me.

331
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,870
She kept hanging around
and doing things for me.

332
00:13:58,905 --> 00:13:59,929
And you liked that.

333
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,837
No, I hated it...

334
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,536
but then I found out
she really likes Eric.

335
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,670
And you were relieved.

336
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:07,941
No.

337
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,743
Disappointed?

338
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,272
No.

339
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,477
Confused.

340
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,008
See, Dad? You always know.

341
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,248
Well, get used to
being confused, pal...

342
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,086
because girls are going
to be rattling your cage...

343
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,318
for the next 60 years.

344
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,327
Till I'm 71?

345
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,453
Yeah, but then

you get a break.

346
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,462
You do?

347
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,123
Yeah. You die.

348
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,429
[Doorbell rings]

349
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,243
Topanga, right?

350
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,767
Have a seat.

351
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,750
Uh, yeah, that's an
interesting way to go...

352
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,776
but I was thinking couch.

353
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,344
Whatever you want.

354
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,123
So what's that?

355
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,389
Movie.

356
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,896
GodziLLa Goes to CoLLege!

357
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,091
Cory's gonna love this!
He loves monster flicks.

358
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,033
oh, he really loved those
brownies you brought over, too.

359
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,899
I mean, uh, you must
really like him a lot...

360
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,426
to do all those
nice things for him.

361
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,200
He's very nice...

362
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,209
in a young kind of way.

363
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,076
Um, see, that's why you
two get along so well...

364
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,773
because you're young, too.

365
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:17,715
No. I've done my chart.

366
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,241
I have a very old soul.

367
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,153
Uh, yeah, here's
a tip for you, Topanga.

368
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:26,420
Not a lot of guys are
going to be after your soul.

369
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,326
When you were talking
to us in class...

370
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,330
you know what I noticed?

371
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,388
What?

372
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,696
Your aura was glowing.

373
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,929
Be that as it may...

374
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,496
my aura's too old for you
to be looking at.

375
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,906
I don't understand.

376
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,308
It's because you're
not ready to understand.

377
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,311
I am ready.

378
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,778
You're not.

379
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,307
oK, I was wrong.

380
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,083
Huh, maybe you are ready.

381
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,214
Look, Cory told me
about you...

382
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,019
and he told me
you're very smart.

383
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,686
I don't have to be smart.

384
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,855
No. Look, you're going
to have to be smart...

385
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,694
because there are
a lot of guys out there...

386
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,666
that won't take aura
for an answer.

387
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,999
What do you mean?

388
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,766
I mean, you've known me
for, like, 5 minutes...

389
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,000
and you think you like me
because you thought I was cute

390
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,508
and who could blame you?

391
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,839
But a real relationship...

392
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:19,640
is based on
so much more than looks.

393
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,442
And if you're old enough
to have these feelings...

394
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,743
then you should know that.

395
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,010
[Doorbell rings]

396
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,041
You are so wise.

397
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,677
Yes, I am.

398
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,517
And that wisdom
comes from knowing...

399
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,023
that if you have a
relationship based on looks...

400
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,720
it's stupid and superfiicial.

401
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,728
Hi, I'm Topanga's sister.

402
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,230
Hi, I'm stupid
and superficial.

403
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:42,063
Cory called and said
Topanga wasn't feeling well...

404
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,227
and wanted to come home.

405
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,736
No, she's feeling fine.

406
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,762
Nobody has to go anywhere.
I mean, just look at her.

407
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,708
I think I'd like to go home.

408
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,210
Is she gone?

409
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,372

to your class?

Be my guest.

429

This better be good, Eric.

430
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:09,083
He was about
to toast this guy.

431
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,249
So, uh,

a couple of days ago...

432
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,259
I pretty much covered the
big high school picture...

433
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,558
but, uh, I left out one

little tiny detail.

434
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,122
You've all known
each other since...

435
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,532
Iike, kindergarten. But
next year there's gonna be...

436
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,536
maybe 9 or 10 other
sixth grade classes...

437
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,594
from different schools...

438
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:26,900
making up your seventh
grade class...

439
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,339
and you're not gonna
know all those kids.

440
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,502
A lot of them are gonna
think differently than you.

441
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,909
What do you mean?

442
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,505
Well, do you smoke
cigarettes?

443
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:36,515
No.

444
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,517
A lot of kids in your
new school will.

445
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,018
A lot of them are gonna try
to pressure you into it.

446
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,747
They're gonna tell how
cool it is to smoke.

447
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,084
You want to be cool,

don't you?

448
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,181
More than you could ever know.

449
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,587
Maybe you'll smoke.

450
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,617
I don't think so.

451
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,220
Why not?

452
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,231
Because according to New
EngLand JournaL of Medicine...

453
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,994
smoking reduces
lung capacity...

454
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,467
Ieads to emphysema...

455
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,470
and causes heart attack
and lung cancer.

456
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:01,405
Well, what if she

thought it was cool?

457
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,634
Then would you smoke?

458
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,939
In a heartbeat.

459
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,606
Welcome to the world
of peer pressure.

460
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,377
So he smokes. Do you
think that's cool?

461
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:14,011
I think anyone who smokes
is a disgusting pig.

462
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,385

that easy. Minkus.

There's all kinds
of pressure.

465
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,455
I mean, what about alcohol?

466
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,861
Could you use somebody else
as an example, please?

467
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:28,593
Sure. What about alcohol?

468
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,033
What about it?
What about drugs?

469
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:33,436
Hey, calm down, Eric.
We're not into that stuff.

470
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,804
All we like is baseball
and comic books.

Yeah, that's what

you like now.

472
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:38,573

00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,408
just like you're
changing schools.

474
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:41,708

to start feeling...

476

gonna understand.

478
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,644
Because you're growing up.

or logical at all.

blown his head off.

The double "L" ls
like the Spanish "Ye".
