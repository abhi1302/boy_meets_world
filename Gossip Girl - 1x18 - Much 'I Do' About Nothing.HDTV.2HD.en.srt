(nate) the drugs were dad's. (lily) your father is facing some other charges.

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,670
i'd have to check with the guys,

33
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,930
but i'm pretty sure we're available. yeah,okay.

34
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,340
oh,my god.

35
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,710

we're opening for the breeders.

39
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,710
i guess that luscious jackson reunion didn't work out.

40
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,930
wait. what was your "oh,my god"?

41
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,470
oh,nothing. nothing at all.

42
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,590
it's day,as in,uh, as in wedding day,

43
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,710

44
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,170
right.

45
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,980
but,uh,congratulations.

46
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,610

48
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,030
amazing.

49
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,460
it's bart.

50
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,720
that's what i was afraid of.

51
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,670
do you want me to answer it? do you want me to kill you?

52
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,650
hello?

53
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,820
no,i know. um...

54
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,670
well,that's because we're not supposed to see each other

55
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,100
on the day of the wedding.

56
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,770
okay. that's fine. i'll meet you in an hour.

57
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,220
i don't know what bart wants,

58
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,370
but i have to go, um,talk to him.

59
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,030
what about? any topics in particular?

60
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,420
well,i'm sure i'll think of something.

61
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,800
ow!

62
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,870
(gasps) who? what? when? where? why?

63
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,990
we were up late plotting against georgina.

64
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,220
we must have dozed off. and you were on the floor.

65
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,210
i didn't want to hurt my back. why? it's not like you ever do anything athletic.

66
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,080
well,that's not entirely true,now is it?

67
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,400
fine. nothing that requires you removing your scarf.

68
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,950
that was one time. it was chilly. enough about the past. before you landed in my bed,

69
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,550
we actually landed on a good idea.

70
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,980
well,i trust you can take it from here.

71
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,190
i have a best man speech to write and no time to write it.

72
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,480
don't worry. i can be bitch enough for both of us. i still got the scars on my back to prove it.

73
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,070
you know,they say if you love something,

74
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,500
you should set it free. ugh. they say when you hate something,

75
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,840
you should slam the door in its face.

76
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,910
i love it when you talk dir--

77
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,190
wow! a stint in rehab sure didn't slow you down a bit,huh?

78
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,370
i haven't felt this good in years.

79
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,150
clean and sober. lawyer's feeling great about the trial.

80
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,710
nice.

81
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,900
well,sometimes things just work out,huh?

82
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,720
sometimes they do.

83
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,160
we can celebrate tonight at the wedding.

84
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,570
when's,uh,when's mom getting back from the hamptons?

85
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,020
she's not gonna make it.

86
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,990
the landscapers royally screwed up the yard.

87
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,170
apparently,all our shrubs look like circus bears.

88
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,850
she's gonna miss the wedding to deal with that?

89
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,770
that,and,uh,the leak we had in the basement.

90
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,450
place is a mess.

91
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,270
i just,um, was kinda hoping

92
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,830
both you guys could meet vanessa.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,230
oh,right. right. i forgot you had a date.

94
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,320
well,you and i can just hang till then.

95
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,270
the yankees are on today.

96
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,630
joba's pitching lights out right now. all right. sounds good.

97
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,760
i gotta take this.

98
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,570
it's my sponsor.

99
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,960
oh,sorry. um,i'll just see you at home then.

100
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,490
hey,it's me.

101
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,170
yes,yes. everything is discussed.

102
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,910
don't be late. don't be early.

103
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,650
i'll slip out right after the ceremony.

104
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,040
just be there,waiting.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
yeah.

106
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,020
hey. mm.

107
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,750
i'm sorry. i know it's early, but i couldn't sleep.

108
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,960
i had to see you,

109
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,460
and you're here, which means you slept here,

110
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,780
which is a relief, but not a surprise. serena.

111
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,540
but that is surprising.

112
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,840
<i>they say love conquers all,</i>

113
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,790
<i>but maybe love</i>  <i>never met georgina sparks.</i>

114
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,950
<i>poor humphrey.</i>

115
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,790
<i>looks like</i>  <i>our resident moral compass</i>

116
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,530
<i>isn't such a straight arrow</i>  <i>after all.</i>

117
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,100
????

118
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,910
the way dan was talking, i thought it was over. over?

119
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,250
maybe not exactly "over," but-- i should go. this is not what i had planned.

120
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,210
no,i think it's exactly what you had planned. serena, this is not sarah's fault.

121
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,920
no,it's <i>georgina's!</i> whatever.

122
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,650
i never meant to get in between you two,i swear.

123
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,260
hey,please. it's okay.

124
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,320
no,it's not, because now she's upset.

125
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,480
yeah,i am,you manipulative psycho bitch!

126
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,650
whoa! whoa! what are you doing? serena! you have been planning this the whole time!

127
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,710
she's lying to you,dan!

128
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,480
good-bye,dan.

129
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,570
i am telling him <i>everything.</i>

130
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,810
tell me what?

131
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,090
what is it that you need to tell me?

132
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,560
so my mom took me to see his parents,

133
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,980
and after talking to them, all i wanted

134
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,850
was to come and find you and tell you everything.

135
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,510
do you hate me?

136
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,000
no. no,no, of course not.

137
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,840
it's--it's just...

138
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,010
it's,uh,it's a lot.

139
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,660
and i...

140
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,690
i really,really wish that you told me this sooner.

141
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,310
no,i-i know it's my fault.

142
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,960
i... i was just so scared.

143
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,590
i-i get it. i get it.

144
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,860
i mean,"hey, i think i killed someone,

145
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,140
"and i'm being blackmailed

146
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,840
by a crazy girl pretending to be someone else"

147
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,980
doesn't quite roll off the tongue.

148
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,770
but it's all over,right?

149
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,220
i mean,we can fix this.

150
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,070
serena,i--last night--

151
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,310
it's okay.

152
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,960
you and georgina and vanessa were just hanging out,

153
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,330
and it got late, and you fell asleep.

154
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,630
i'll see you at the wedding.

155
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,670
when i told my mom not to go away with rufus,

156
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,480
i said it was 'cause you and i were forever.

157
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,950
i knew i was right.

158
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,200
(blair) hello?

159
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,320
blair,it's dan.

160
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,930
bart,darling.

161
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,420
what is the big mystery?

162
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,260
what are we doing here?

163
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,910
this is the first building i ever bought.

164
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,300
well,it's quite impressive.

165
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,570
you had a good eye even--even back then.

166
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,420
sometimes i like to come here, just to...

167
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,140
feel how it felt the first time i saw it.

168
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,360
well,there is a comfort

169
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,890
in revisiting the things that we loved...

170
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,330
when we were young.

171
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,240
but the truth is, i'm not that young man anymore.

172
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,530
i think maybe i've outgrown this place,

173
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,950
and holding on to it is keeping me from moving forward

174
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,190
with what's most important to me now.

175
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:53,100
what do you think i should do?

176
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,210
i think you should let it go.

177
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,810
i agree.

178
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,880
now can you do the same for me?

179
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,670
<i>(georgina) hey,it's sarah.</i>  <i>you know what to do.</i>

180
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,410
voice mail.

181
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,790
okay,like we talked about.

182
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,470
hey,hey,it's me. d

183
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,390
um,after you left,serena and i got in a huge fight,

184
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,760
and--and she said all this crazy stuff.

185
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,930
i honestly don't know what to believe,

186
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:46,370
but--but what i do know is i want to see you.

187
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,990
so,uh,call me.

188
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,090
excellent wot work. she's totally calling back.

189
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,770
this is so weird.

190
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,530
i don't normally do plots against people.

191
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,450
don't worry,virgin. i'll talk you through it.

192
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,630
right on schedule.

193
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,570
hey.

194
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,640
hey. i just got your message.

195
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,630
oh,good,good.

196
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,180
so... sorry about this morning with serena.

197
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,100
that was very awkward, to say the least. yeah,a little bit.

198
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,730
last night really changed things for me.

199
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,890
serena and i left things kind of uncertain,

200
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,730
so i-i think i wanna end it.

201
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,350
i <i>know</i> i do.

202
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,740
will you meet me?

203
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,300
our spot in the park by the pond?

204
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,020
see you there.

205
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,440
we're turning around.

206
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,530
one last battle, and the war is won.

207
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,460
humphrey, you are a born liar.

208
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,790
thanks,i think.

209
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,680
all that stuff about last night was genius.

210
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,620
anything you wanna tell me?

211
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,840
uh,no. like you said, just born to lie.

212
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,700
honestly,dan,

213
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,700
last night was fun,

214
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,920
but i didn't really know what it would all mean to you.

215
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,990
well,i-i normally don't jump into things like that,

216
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:12,270
so when i do,it means a lot. me,too. that's why i think we should be together forever.

217
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,920
georgina,look, serena told me everything.

218
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,910
all right? and i believe her.

219
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,240
no,you don't understand. she was upset and--and jealous.

220
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,200
i'm sure she told you all kinds of things

221
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,290
to make you think the worst of me. no,just stop it.

222
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,340
i never meant for this to happen,but it did,

223
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,020
and i know you feel it,too.

224
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,940
i mean,how else do you explain last night?

225
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,930
i don't know. i don't know, and i wish i could.

226
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,920
s-so you're just gonna go back to serena like nothing happened

227
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,870
and just leave me all alone?

228
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,490
oh,you're not alone,g. i'm here now,

229
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,950
and i brought some people who really,really want to see you.

230
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,790
i think you remember your parents.

231
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,210
<i>the only thing feared</i>  <i>by the spawn of satan?</i>

232
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,810
<i>mom and dad.</i>

233
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:00,920
<i>leave it to blair waldorf</i>

234
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,320
<i>to know that bitches</i>  <i>don't just happen.</i> i...

235
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,660
<i>they're made...</i>

236
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:08,980
<i>by parents even more wicked</i>  <i>than their offspring.</i>

237
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,860
okay,i'm...

238
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,600
mom,dad,this is not what you think.

239
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,970
you have to believe me. there,there,georgie. it's gonna be okay.

240
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,290
no,this time,it won't. or it won't.

241
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,350
your parents were so worried,g. they told me everything--

242
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,130
how you're supposed to be on the equestrian circuit

243
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,840
but sold your show pony for cocaine.

244
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,410
that was a difficult time, but i-i've put that behind me. when? when you were in rehab?

245
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,660
it's hard to get clean when you hitchhike into town,

246
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,010
steal a credit card and book a ticket to ibiza. you didn't see where they sent me.

247
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,630
i mean,that place was awful. it was--it was in utah.

248
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,350
at least i lasted longer than lohan. we were trying to help.

249
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,770
i've had enough. i have to go. georgina,stop.

250
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,450
yes,stay,georgina. i'll go.

251
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,780
oh,that reminds me.

252
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,900
i almost forgot to leave you the information

253
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,660
that i discussed with your parents. what's this?

254
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,560
where you're going. a boot camp for troubled girls.

255
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,780
(mr. sparks) blair was kind enough to do some research. (lowers voice) haven't you heard?

256
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,560
i'm the crazy bitch around here.

257
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,590
(normal voice) have fun at reform school.

258
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,970
so how long will you be on the road?

259
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,180
well,i'll get the details. we'll figure it all out.

260
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,800
but it's kinda cool,right? oh,it's very cool.

261
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,100
affirmation from my son. this is an historic moment.

262
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,630
well,last night must have been pretty historic as well,

263
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:31,380
considering when i came home, you hadn't. yeah,last night was pretty special.

264
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,360
i'm sorry i skipped out early, by the way,dad.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
by the way,dad.

266
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,630
i-i'd love to hear all about it,

267
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,110
but i have a,uh,a wedding.

268
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,820
<i>the</i> wedding.

269
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,790
right. the wedding. of course.

270
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,910
so it's,uh,it's happening.

271
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,290
y-yeah. yeah,dad,it is.

272
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,200
serena told me something about you and lily.

273
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,730
i-i don't understand it fully,

274
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,550
but the reason lily stayed away

275
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,550
is 'cause serena asked her to.

276
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,890
thanks,dan.

277
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,110
that's,uh...

278
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,280
well,just thanks.

279
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,980
check out my latest creation.

280
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,150
what do you think?

281
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,500
you clean up nice,abrams.

282
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,410
* i'm feeling rough, i'm feeling raw *

283
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,140
* i'm in the prime of my life

284
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,690
* let's make some music, make some money *

285
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,160
thank you.

286
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,950
* find some models for wives

287
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,350
* i'll move to paris

288
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,190
* shoot some heroin and... with the stars *

289
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,740
best man speech going that well?

290
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,900
there won't be a dry eye in the house. trust me.

291
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,800
how did things go with whore-gina? not a dry eye there either.

292
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,780
good to know i wasn't missed. dan humphrey actually lent a hand.

293
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,240
it was nice to see him get his dirty for once.

294
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,360
not sure how much fun he had, though.

295
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:16,470
no one ever enjoys their first time. except you. save me a dance?

296
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,540
now that georgina is done, so are you and i.

297
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,580
she was the last thing we had in common.

298
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,340
(chuckles) break a leg.

299
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,140
i think i just did.

300
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,160
* said yeah,yeah,yeah

301
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,590
there he is. best man ready to do his dad proud?

302
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,940
captain,good to see you.

303
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,840
nate.

304
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,100
clearly,i missed something when i was away.

305
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,390
little advice,fellas? you've been friends a long time.

306
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,370
whoever she is, she's not worth it. couldn't agree more.

307
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,830
that's the problem.

308
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:57,840
hey.

309
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,330
hey.

310
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,130
how go the prenuptials?

311
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,950
well,my mom's done this enough times.

312
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,600
you'd think she'd be a pro by now,but i don't know.

313
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,520
her heart doesn't really seem in it.

314
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,070
you think this will be us in 20 years,

315
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,270
onto our fourth husbands?

316
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,660
a girl can dream. (laughs)

317
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:20,930
speaking of true love, dan isn't here.

318
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:21,900
he's coming.

319
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,090
so all is forgiven?

320
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,450
i'm working on it.

321
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,500
what do you have to work on?

322
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,530
he's the one that has to forgive <i>you.</i>

323
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,030
yeah.

324
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,890
yeah, that's what i'm working on.

325
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,660
you were supposed to get here during the reception

326
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,210
so no one would know i was gone.

327
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,660
you don't exactly blend in, you know?

328
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,650
you gonna pay me or not?

329
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,520
here.

330
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,450
good-bye.

331
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,950
do me a favor and keep an eye on mr. archibald.

332
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,020
need a hand with that?

333
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,130
rufus, what are you doing here?

334
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,540
i thought we had security.

335
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,620
you want them to throw me out?

336
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,530
well,i'd like the option,

337
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,890
considering how much i'm paying them. so you want me to leave?

338
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,780
i didn't say that. do you want me to call off this wedding?

339
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,880
and if you so much as nod yes, i will go out there,

340
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,450
and i will tell your fianc?and your guests

341
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,230
they have  go home. i didn't say that either.

342
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,070
we can figure this out.

343
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,420
oh,can we? it's been 20 years,

344
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,090
and i don't think <i>this</i>

345
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,540
is the moment to hash out the details.

346
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,220
look,we've already had the "morning after" today.

347
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,770
what's gonna happen tomorrow morning?

348
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,440
lil,i just got a divorce. i don't wanna get married again,

349
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,950
at least,not right away.

350
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,640
but i do.

351
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,650
i've been alone for quite a while now,and you know what?

352
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:16,200
it's hard. and i love bart, not just because he has money.

353
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,530
i have enough money. not that you can ever have enough money,

354
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,220
but... i'm rambling,

355
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,660
and i'm nervous, and you make me nervous.

356
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,750
that's a good thing,right? there are just too many questions,too many.

357
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,410
what about dan and serena? whatever their feelings are for each other,

358
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,740
if we're standing here 20 years in the making...

359
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,270
yeah,those 20 years--

360
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,120
they have to count for something,don't they?

361
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,200
i think they count for everything.

362
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,640
where's my mom?

363
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,500
shouldn't we be saying vows around now?

364
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,260
your mother is a wonderful woman,eric,

365
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,630
but being on time-- not a strong suit.

366
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,790
let's pray lily is as slow getting dressed as you are. you said you knew how to make a tie.

367
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,140
how would i know how to make a tie? i hope serena doesn't kill me.

368
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,980
for being a few minutes late to her mom's wedding? well,that, amongst other things.

369
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,360
i-i really have to talk to her. let me guess. georgina?

370
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,090
i thought if i confronted her, it would make things better. but it didn't and now...

371
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:15,690
i have to tell her. well,no time like the present. i-i'm gonna find my seat,okay?

372
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:16,690
hey.

373
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,970
hey. hey. i have to talk to you.

374
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,490
i can't. i have to go. no,it--it can't wait. it's about georgina.

375
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,840
dan,it's okay. i don't wanna know.

376
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,000
no,you need to. i didn't sleep with her.

377
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,700
w-well...

378
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,750
but... i-i may as well have.

379
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,700
serena,there you are.

380
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,660
come. yeah? come,come,come.

381
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,950
i have to go.

382
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,340
and here we go. are you sure about this?

383
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,310
ask me again, and i'll change my mind.

384
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,880
i love you,lily.

385
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,030
i love you,too,rufus.

386
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,030
then have a great wedding and try not to trip or anything.

387
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,740
oh! i can't believe you put that in my mind.

388
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,030
well,luckily, i have done this before.

389
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,940
hey. hey.

390
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:17,560
oh! how rude! can you believe how late she is?

391
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,560
<i>dearly beloved,</i>

392
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:07,000
<i>we are gathered here today</i>  <i>in the face of this company</i>

393
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,060
<i>to watch this man...</i>

394
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,870
<i>and this woman...</i>

395
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,490
<i>totally eff things up.</i>

396
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,740
<i>excuse me</i>  <i>while i pull out a hankie</i>

397
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,870
<i>and pass it to s. and d.</i>

398
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,450
<i>looks like i'm not the only one</i>  <i>who cries at weddings.</i>

399
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,390
how's your food?

400
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,190
good. thanks.

401
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,330
i was being sarcastic. you haven't eaten a bite.

402
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,200
(lowers voice) let's go somewhere quiet. we can talk. excuse me. i need some air.

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ere quiet. we can talk. excuse me. i need some air.

404
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,620
you sure?

405
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,370
i'll be right back.

406
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,360
(lowered voice) i need to talk to you.

407
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,780
your father's leaving.

408
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,830
he just stepped out to call my mom. everything okay?

409
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,800
yes. (normal voice) no.

410
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,730
(lowered voice) he just asked to have his car brought around.

411
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:19,240
he probably left his phone in it. before the ceremony,i saw him with a guy doing a deal.

412
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,280
it looked like drugs.

413
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,480
my father is clean,chuck. i don't need you spying on him.

414
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,710
look,i know you hate me.

415
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,020
i was in love with blair, and i'm sorry.

416
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:31,700
we do not have time to argue about this.

417
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:48,030
whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! stop! stop! stop!

418
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,780
dad, what the hell are you doing?

419
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,230
i left you a note at home.

420
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:02,130
yeah? what's it say? it says i'm sorry.

421
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,850
for what?

422
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,190
dad,if you've relapsed, it's okay. we'll get you help.

423
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,890
chuck saw you earlier.

424
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,040
i wasn't buying drugs.

425
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,510
a passport? you're skipping town?

426
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,850
i'm gonna be a much better father to you from dominica

427
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,330
than i will be from jail.

428
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:25,150
no,dad. i know you're scared, but we'll get through the trial.

429
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,360
no,we won't.

430
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,590
i'm guilty,nate. i'm facing 25 years.

431
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,480
(scoffs) so all this stuff about things looking good

432
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,310
and working out,huh? yeah.

433
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,410
what about mom?

434
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,960
who do you think's paying for the private plane?

435
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,270
why didn't you tell me any of this?

436
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,180
'cause i didn't want you to know anything,be an accessory.

437
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,260
this is the best thing for everyone.

438
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,780
i need you to step up right now.

439
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,670
be the man of the family for your mother.

440
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,420
it's been that for a while now.

441
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,420
nate.

442
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,810
that's for mom.

443
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,300
looks like nate isn't a fan of the fish...

444
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,620
or his date.

445
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,660
blair,i'm with nate, and you're at the singles table.

446
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,590
deal with it.

447
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,770
i just feel sorry for you is all.

448
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,120
dating an archibald is a tortured process--

449
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,000
the endless supply of family drama,

450
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,700
the fact that he never really got over serena.

451
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,070
though,falling for someone who's in love with serena--

452
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,940
you already know how that feels,don't you?

453
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,620
hey,have you guys seen chuck? it's time for his speech.

454
00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:00,610
i'll look for him. maybe he's with my date.

455
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,730
excuse me.

456
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,020
so thank you.

457
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,420
it's your dad.

458
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,650
it's bigger than... all the other stuff.

459
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,030
look,i'm sorry...

460
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,890
for all of it.

461
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,560
so am i.

462
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,660
so you said you loved her.

463
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,160
it's,uh...

464
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,240
well,i never heard you say that before...

465
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,960
about anyone.

466
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,590
ready to go back in?

467
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,630
i don't think i'm going back in.

468
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,930
just,um,tell vanessa i--

469
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,200
tell vanessa what?

470
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,630
they're looking for you inside.

471
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,150
it's a long story.

472
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,540
i have time.

473
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,460
no. hey,hey. don't--don't run away from me.

474
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,920
dan,it's okay.

475
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,450
so you hooked up with georgina.

476
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,470
i kinda figured that

477
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,680
when i saw her coming out of your bedroom this morning,

478
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:39,070
but i-i'm willing to let it go.

479
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,860
i don't wanna break up with you.

480
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,900
maybe...

481
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,020
maybe <i>i</i> want to break up with you.

482
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,140
maybe i can't just"let it go."

483
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:59,230
you lied to me over and over,

484
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,230
and it was easy for you.

485
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,360
no,it wasn't easy. i got seduced by a girl pretending to be someone else,

486
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,630
and you knew. but i couldn't say anything.

487
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,330
well,because you-- you were afraid i'd find out

488
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,830
you thought you killed someone.

489
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:12,230
i was hoping you'd understand.

490
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:16,490
i am the most understanding person in the world.

491
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,930
but this?

492
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,040
and--and--and this is not about who you used to be,

493
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,240
your "past," or who you were when we met.

494
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,490
i mean,the only reason i was with georgina

495
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,710
was because yesterday morning,

496
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,530
you slept with two random guys you met in a bar.

497
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,400
no,no,i-i didn't. i just said that.

498
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,640
how is that less crazy?

499
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,810
because i thought it would be easier to forgive

500
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,980
than what i really did.

501
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,020
so what,dan?

502
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,270
we're exactly where we were at the bass' brunch

503
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,880
when we first started dating.

504
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:57,910
i'm not who you thought i was, and you can't forgive that.

505
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,990
i-i just think too much has happened.

506
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,890
i don't know how to make things go back to what they were.

507
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,680
so that's it then?

508
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,710
(crying) it's just...

509
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,370
"have a good summer. i'll-- i'll see you back at school"?

510
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,210
i guess.

511
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,720
yeah.

512
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,770
i'd like to propose a toast.

513
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,880
my father is someone who goes after what he wants,

514
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,230
and lily van der woodsen was no exception.

515
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,770
in typical bass man fashion, his pursuit was direct,

516
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,790
and at times, not exactly subtle.

517
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,120
one thing i learned

518
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,700
from my father's courtship of lily

519
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:20,640
is the importance of perseverance--

520
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,970
that in the face of true love, you don't just give up,

521
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,460
even if the object of your affection

522
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,900
is begging you to.

523
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,100
and one thing i learned from lily

524
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,830
is the importance of forgiveness.

525
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,120
she gave my father the gift of a second chance,

526
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,070
and in kind,

527
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,480
i've watched him become someone actually worthy of that gift.

528
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:45,120
and one day,

529
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,530
i hope i'll be lucky enough

530
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,690
to find someone who will do the same for me.

531
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,700
(death cab for cutie) * even less that we could do

532
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,590
to the happy couple.

533
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,480
* the ice from getting thinner

534
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:06,130
* under me and you

535
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,700
* we bury our love

536
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:16,460
* in a wintry grave

537
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,750
that was quite a speech.

538
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,910
all your hard work must have paid off.

539
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,680
that wasn't what i wrote.

540
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,960
i was inspired in the moment.

541
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,540
look,i know i said some horrible things,even for me.

542
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,280
you mean blogging to gossip girl about our sex life

543
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,090
and comparing me to your dad's sweaty old horse?

544
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,930
what's your point?

545
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,400
what's yours?

546
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,110
you don't belong with nate.

547
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,460
never have,never will.

548
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,280
you don't belong with anyone.

549
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,920
* and when the spring arrived

550
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:57,580
* we were taken by surprise when the... *

551
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,410
oh,sorry. i,uh, i'm looking for vanessa.

552
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,270
have you seen her? i'm trying to get out of here.

553
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,920
no,i haven't seen her.

554
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,290
* nothing was left

555
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,770
okay.

556
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,650
serena,dan,out on the floor. oh,no,thank you.

557
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,440
oh,no. no,no. the bride and groom are asking for photos. here we go.

558
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,560
oh,that's not necessary. yes,it is.

559
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:23,110
you're gonna want to remember this night forever,yeah?

560
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,620
i'm sorry.

561
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,520
just smile.

562
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,930
(lowers voice) let's take it slow this time.

563
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,230
do it right.

564
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,610
chuck bass is a romantic.

565
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,770
who knew?

566
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,080
now <i>you</i> do.

567
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,960
that's all that matters.

568
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,230
* we're not the same,dear

569
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:57,450
* and it seems to me

570
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:01,270
* there's nowhere we can go

571
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,370
he's gone. you can let go now.

572
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,630
i know.

573
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,790
i don't want to.

574
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:10,850
* and it saddens me to say

575
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:15,740
* what we both knew was true

576
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:19,910
* that the ice was getting thinner *

577
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:24,860
* under me and you

578
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:29,150
* the ice was getting thinner

579
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:34,600
* under me and you

580
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,130
hey,jen. ooh! oh,my god,dad.

581
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,080
well,hello to you,too. mom's out getting bagels, dan's at the gallery,

582
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,320
and the mail just came. well,i appreciate the play-by-play.

583
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,490
it feel as if i'm there. yeah,well,uh,

584
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,610
????

585
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:55,330
what???

586
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,520
i don't know. i'm too scared to open it.

587
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,700
what if i didn't get it? what if you did?

588
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,620
(laughs) okay. i'm opening it. hold my hand over the phone. i got ya.

589
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,530
and...

590
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,890
aah! i got it!

591
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,120
that's great,jen.

592
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,140
does it say who it's with?

593
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,380
yeah. um,it's with...

594
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,480
(chuckles) eleanor waldorf designs.

595
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,150
well, isn't that blair's mom?

596
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,390
yeah,it sure is.

597
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,690
so... tuscany with chuck?

598
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,390
sounds romantic...

599
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,660
minus the chuck part.

600
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,620
he invited me-- in his father's private plane.

601
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,810
and i was headed to france, so...

602
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:40,530
so it's worth a week with chuck to avoid airport security?

603
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,090
oh,don't worry. i'm gonna frisk him.

604
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,990
oh! (laughs) b.,gross!

605
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,860
what can i say? he brings out the worst in me.

606
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,470
and weirdly,i think i bring out the best in him.

607
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,500
he's been a perfect gentleman this whole week.

608
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,700
is that why you're driving yourself to the airport?

609
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,240
he wanted to see his dad before he left.

610
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,240
besides,we're taking the helicopter to teterboro.

611
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:02,370
i have to sit in the jump seat so that i can tell the pilot

612
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,270
if i have any thoughts on his flying.

613
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:08,540
oh,b.,what's it gonna take to get relax? chuck.

614
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,820
oh! god!

615
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,490
my ears are bleeding! make it stop! (laughs)

616
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,410
you gonna be okay? alone all summer

617
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,740
without your best friend who always gets you out of trouble?

618
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,910
yeah. i'm-- i'm looking forward

619
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:24,860
to staying out of trouble for a while. have you talked to dan?

620
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,330
no. not since the wedding.

621
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:31,450
it's for the best-- for him,for me.

622
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,840
i'm fine. (laughs)

623
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,300
(chuck) yeah,i'll be taking off soon.

624
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,990
i wanted to catch my dad before i left,

625
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,250
see how the honeymoon went,

626
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:43,030
catch a glimpse of a man in love. well,why don't you just take a look in the mirror,chuck?

627
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,120
(laughs) taking blair to europe,huh?

628
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,420
things are getting pretty serious. it's no big deal.

629
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,300
my dad's jet was going to italy on business.

630
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,540
blair was going to france. so are you planning

631
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:58,550
to spend the summer sweating it out in brooklyn? uh,i think my time across the bridge is over.

632
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,970
(chuck) nathaniel,what happened with you and punky brewster?

633
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,280
so tell me. what--what exactly happened with you and man-bangs?

634
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:07,670
(laughs) he <i>is</i> prettier than me, but that wasn't the problem. and so what was it then?

635
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,160
the,uh,the whole perpetually stoned,brooding guy thing? i actually enjoyed the quiet.

636
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:14,610
it was a nice change of pace from you. oh. was it his past with serena?

637
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,780
no. that's just your issue.

638
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,210
it must've been,uh,

639
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,330
the--the different worlds thing,right?

640
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:22,290
one of you always feeling like a fish out of water?

641
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,840
i know exactly what you're doing.

642
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,160
ask me enough questions about nate,

643
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,890
and i won't ask you about serena. best offense is always a strong defense.

644
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,740
i,um...

645
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,660
i'm not ready to talk about it.

646
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,840
her.

647
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,040
good. then maybe it'll be quiet for 30 seconds.

648
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,610
no,no,no,no,no. you better get used to it,abrams.

649
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,080
welcome to the summer of dan humphrey,

650
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,770
babblin' at your ass 24/7, from dusk till dawn.

651
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,810
come labor day, you're gonna be so sick of me.

652
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:55,850
it's been 13 years, and i'm still not sick of you. oh,not for lack of trying.

653
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,390
(nate) vanessa's a great girl, but i have too much

654
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:01,980
going on right now. all right. all right. bye. hey!

655
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,300
hey! i was just seeing off blair.

656
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,470
i was just on the phone with chuck.

657
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,820
blair and chuck--now there's a couple you can root for.

658
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,410
yeah,well,if they're happy, i guess i'm happy.

659
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,660
oh,come on,nate. when have you ever been happy?

660
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,500
wow! the gloves are off today, aren't they?

661
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,160
(laughs) i am feeling frisky.

662
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:22,430
you know how i get in the summer. (laughs) yeah,i do.

663
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,080
well,you won't have to witness any of it.

664
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,790
i'm locking myself away in the hamptons house.

665
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,390
well,it is a summer to reflect... alone.

666
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,510
i could not agree more.

667
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,450
i just need to take a break away from everything and everyone.

668
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,920
yeah.

669
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,190
hey.

670
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,930
um,if you wanna reflect alone together,

671
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,500
i'll be around.

672
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,970
what are you up to now?

673
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,940
excuse me. is that the bass helicopter? no,it's not here yet.

674
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,730
are you on the bass marketing team,too? no,i'm a guest of chuck bass.

675
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,450
if he's anything like his father,

676
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,420
he must be... terrifying.

677
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:11,780
he's not all bad. he is taking me to tuscany. that's romantic.

678
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,970
so where is he? on his way.

679
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:17,330
i had to get here early. i like the jump seat. oh.

680
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,790
what? nothing. it's just...  <i>i</i> like the jump seat.

681
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:25,070
i have this thing about flying, and it makes me feel more... in control?

682
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,820
yeah. yeah.

683
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,180
who's that?

684
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,950
blair. i should get going.

685
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,610
i just wanted to see you before i disappeared for the summer.

686
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:37,840
i'm glad you had a good trip.

687
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,530
i hope you have a good trip, too. you deserve it.

688
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,990
and,i must say, i'm proud of you.

689
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,460
dad,my best man speech was a week ago,and it was nothing.

690
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,270
polite? modest? you really are growing up.

691
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,540
let's not get carried away.

692
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,550
i plan on holding on to my youth for as long as possible.

693
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,050
sometimes that choice isn't up to you.

694
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,470
that's the best thing about blair.

695
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:02,100
she knows me, knows i'll never change.

696
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,960
yeah...

697
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,390
until you take her away to europe on a private jet.

698
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,570
<i>that</i> is gonna change everything.

699
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,560
but that's a good thing, son.

700
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:15,890
having a real girlfriend

701
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,380
will force you to learn about responsibility,

702
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,280
sacrifice,

703
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,310
being faithful,

704
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,830
taking into account somebody else's feelings,

705
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,870
not just your own.

706
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,210
feelings?

707
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,250
all the partying and the women...

708
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:37,990
you will come back from this summer a new man.

709
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,890
take my word for it.

710
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,940
oh,i will.

711
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,460
oh! there you are. this is amelia.

712
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,080
she's been helping me with the apartment renovations.

713
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,490
great. nice to meet you.

714
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,600
amelia.

715
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,310
a moment?

716
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,650
what's this?

717
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,200
i was hoping we could discuss

718
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:42,320
what you have planned for <i>my</i> room. and who are you?

719
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,430
i'm chuck bass.

720
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,200
everything all right?

721
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,230
yeah. it--it's chuck. i guess his dad is getting in late,

722
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,650
and he won't be able to make the flight.

723
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,740
but he's booking something commercial.

724
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,030
well,i'd be willing to flip you for the jump seat.

725
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,870
bart did just get the jet reupholstered,

726
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,540
and i do like when the ladies make you those cookies.

727
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,240
what's ten hours?

728
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:22,270
absence makes the heart grow fonder,right?

729
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,990
<i>they say a leopard</i>  <i>can't change his spots,</i>

730
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,430
<i>but some things</i> do <i>change--</i>

731
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,330
<i>the path not taken</i>  <i>can become a road trip...</i>

732

<i>being grounded</i>

733
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,110
<i>can lead to something</i>  <i>ground-breaking...</i>

734

735
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:44,020

736
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,020
* do you wanna make love to me? *

737
