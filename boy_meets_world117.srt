1
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:03,935
-Hi, Dad.

-Whoa, ho, ho.

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:07,930
What, baseball? In this storm?

I don't think so.

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,208
Dad, that's a drizzle.

4
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:13,679
[Thunder]

5
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:16,182
A thundery, stormy
kind of drizzle.

6
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:17,342
Mm-hmm. Forget it, wise guy.

7
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:18,681
Find something to do
around here.

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,448
I've been sitting inside
all day.

9
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,079
What am I supposed to do
for fun?

10
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,522
Have tea with your sister.

11
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:28,460
-I made red zinger.
-Yeah, zing this.

12
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,793
Somebody needs a nap.

13
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,994
My life bites--

14
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,003
boring, predictable...

15
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,527
never a surprise.

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,231
Don't turn on the lights.

17
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:44,676
Shawn?

18
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,680
The cops are after me,
maybe even the FBl.

19
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,979
You're not involved,

unless you want to be.

20
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:52,918
[Thunder]

21
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,582
I'm in!

22
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,126
[Theme music playing]

23
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,946
You can't tell anybody I'm here.

24
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,921
Right, right.

25
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,650
How'd you get in here, anyway?

26
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,124
I climbed up the tree
into your window.

27
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,854
I didn't want anyone to see me.

28
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:11,193
Cory, I'm a fugitive.

29
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,200
Fugitive? Cool! Give me details.

30
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,670
oK.
You remember that cherry bomb?

31
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,969
oh, no. Feeny found it.
You're suspended!

32
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,374
Nothing good ever happens to me.

33
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,436
All day I kept feeling it
in my pocket...

34
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,040
all round and waxy,
just begging me to light it.

35
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,606
I mean, I could actually
hear it saying...

36
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:34,246
"Light me. Light me, Shawn.
Blow something up."

37
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,754
Well, what did you blow up?

38
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,121
Well, I was riding my bike
down "K" Street--

39
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,955
You blew up "K" Street?

40
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:44,293
-I park at the Market Giant--
-You blew up the Market Giant?

41
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:48,097
That's my dad's store.
I have mixed feelings.

42
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:50,729
But there on the ground
by the shopping carts--

43
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:51,931
a matchbook.

44
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,463
It was like a sign, you know,
saying, "Now, Shawn.

45
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,635
Now. Let the sucker blow."

46
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,235
So you're holding
the lit cherry bomb--

47
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,404
I don't remember lighting it.

48
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:00,708
But suddenly
there it was in my hand...

49
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,339
sparks flying off the fuse...

50
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:06,580
and suddenly, I realized,
this thing's going to go off.

51
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,884
I mean, I could lose an eye,
lose an arm...

52
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:12,119
wind up looking like
our shop teacher.

53
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,593
So why didn't you just throw it?

54
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,562
There were people all around.
I could've hurt somebody.

55
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:21,829
I just knew I had to get it
far, far away, so I mailed it.

56
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,360
You blew up
a United States mailbox?

57
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,032
Well, it's still standing...

58
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:31,773
although the sides did puff out
like a fat guy burping.

59
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,076
All the stuff inside
got torched though.

60
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,480
You should have seen
the flames...

61
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,815
and the freaked-out look
on people's faces.

62
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:43,152
Why am I never around
when the great stuff happens?

63
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,158
I think I shook the cops.

64
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,660
What do I do now?
I can't go home.

65
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,788
Why not? It wasn't like
you did it on purpose.

66
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,298
Look, I did it.

67
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,959
That's the only part
my old man's going to hear.

68
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,097
I stepped over the line
this time, Cory.

69
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,128
I'm going to get killed
for this.

70
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,503
What are you going to do?

71
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,373
You think I could stay here
for a couple days...

72
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,002
just until I figure things out?

73
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,013
Fine with me.
I'll go ask my mom.

74
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,709
You're really new at this,
aren't you?

75
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,115
What?

76
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,120
No one can know I'm here,

especially not your folks.

77
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,348
They'll tell my mom and dad.

78
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,879
oh, right, right, right.
What about Eric?

79
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,382
He's dumb, but I think he'll

notice a third guy in the room.

80
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,555
I'll hide in the closet.

81
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,690
Have you seen my closet?

82
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,932
oK, under the bed.

83
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:35,670
oK, but you may not be the only
living thing under there.

84
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,576
Hi. How are you doing?

85
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,080
Jeez, how do you live like this?

86
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,809
MOTHER: Cory. dinner!

87
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,010
So what do you say? Can I stay?

88
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,518
of course you can.

89
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,851
Now get out of that wet stuff
and put on some of my clothes.

90
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,356
I'll sneak up some food.

91
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,121
Remember, I'm your accomplice.
I'm Accomplice Boy.

92
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,628
-Thanks a lot, man.

-No, thank you.

93
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,565
It's about time there's
a little excitement around here.

94
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,626
Listen. Listen, Cor.

You're going downstairs...

95
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,069
to keep something
from your parents...

96
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,005
and if it was me,

I wouldn't worry...

97
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,634
but I know you.
You're going to act weird.

98
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,303
Attempt to stay cool, huh?

99
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:15,178
Cool? Me? Ha!
They won't notice a thing.

100
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,288
Dad and Mom,

I have so much homework.

101
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,163
I'm going to eat in my room,
and I need fuel.

102
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,294
I need lots of fuel.
I need enough fuel for two...

103
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,394
although
there's only one of me...

104
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,496
which is so interesting,
don't you think?

105
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,172
Cory,
you're grounded for two weeks.

106
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,336
What did I do?

107
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,503
I don't know,

but the way you're behaving...

108
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,809
it's got to be
at least two weeks.

109
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,409
Dad, I can honestly tell you
I haven't done a thing.

110
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,919
[Thump]
What was that?

111
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,946
My homework fell off my desk.

112
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,391
There's so darn much of it.
Ha ha ha.

113
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:01,519
oK.

114
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,963
What are you, bowling up here?

115
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,161
Shawn?

116
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,099
I guess my pants
are a little short on you.

117
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,441
No, no, no, they fit great.

118
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,040
Anyone ever tell you
you're built like a chimp?

119
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,983
Did anybody ever tell you...

120
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,782
don't insult
the boy with the food?

121
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:31,086
No ketchup? I alWays have
ketchup on my meat loaf.

122
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,058
oh, you're absolutely right.

123
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,061
I'm going to go downstairs
right now...

124
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,494
and tell my mom that Shawn...

125
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,554
the cherry bomb
mailbox killer...

126
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,623
would like a little ketchup
on his meat loaf.

127
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,636
Fine, fine.

I'll eat this dry meat brick.

128
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,036
-oh, Cory!
-Hide!

129
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,409
Think you're pretty smooth,
don't you?

130
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,605
-I know what's going on.
-You do?

131
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:57,879
Uh-huh. Smuggling food, strange
noises, the smell in here.

132
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,078
Smell?

133
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,984
Yeah,

I tried the same thing once.

134
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,455
You're hiding a puppy, huh?
Where is he?

135
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,584
Come here, puppy.
Where's the cute little boy?

136
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,662
oh, it's a big puppy.

137
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,563
oK, Eric, you're right.

138
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,058
I'm hiding a puppy,
but I let it go.

139
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,765
-When?
-Uh, just a minute ago.

140
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,570
-You let the puppy go?
-Uh-huh.

141
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,077
out a second story window?

142
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,170
What was I thinking?

143
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,113
Hey, guys.

144
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,117
Mom, where are you going?

145
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,618
It's time for Morgan's bath...

146
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,120
and her door to the bathroom
is locked.

147
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,952
Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.

148
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,958
[Shouting] You're going
into the bathroom...

149
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,960
to give Morgan a bath?

150
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,224
Nothing gets past you.

151
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,463
Hey, Cor?

152
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,500
Lassie came home.

153
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,734
I can explain What he's doing.

154
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,366
No, no, no.

Look, I don't even want to know.

155
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,535
I mean, if I know the truth...

156
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,703
I only have to lie
when questioned.

157
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:01,009
I don't want to know anything
about you two.

158
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,141
Let's just cut to my bribe,
shall we?

159
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,477
Dry brick of meat?

160
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,112
Yeah, that's tempting...

161
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,986
but I was thinking,
oh, I don't know...

162
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,492
you two take over
all my household chores?

163
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,959
In the bizarro World.

164
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,520
Eric,

I don't even do my own chores.

165
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,088
FATHER: Cory! Eric!

166
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:25,171
Trash night. Whose turn
is it to take out the cans?

167
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,400
You know, Dad, an interesting
thing. See, we were just--

168
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,408
oh, no! My turn, right?

169
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,000
oh. Hey, thanks.

170
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,714
I think Shawn was making
a daring political statement.

171
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,948
And what statement was that,

build more prisons?

172
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,455
You guys don't know
anything about it.

173
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,084
Sorry I'm late.

174
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,423
I see you've all heard...

175
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,792
about Mr. Hunter's little stunt
yesterday.

176
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,626
I just spoke with his parents.

177
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,360
Evidently, Shawn
didn't come home last night.

178
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:58,360
I imagine no one here
has heard from him.

179
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:59,929
Me?

180
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,838
What makes you think
I heard from Shawn?

181
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,843
I was addressing
the entire class.

182
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,640
Yeah,

but you make it sound like...

183
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,908
I lit the cherry bomb
and stuck it in the mailbox...

184
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,915
on "K" Street
near the Market Giant.

185
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,682
I'm guessing.

186
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:19,014
He claims he hasn't spoken
with Shawn since the incident...

187
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,084
yet he knows
the precise location...

188
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,721
knows Hunter's plot
involved a cherry bomb.

189
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:27,824
I smell conspiracy.
I smell cover-up.

190
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:32,236
I smell a nerd
with nine fingers.

191
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:35,901
Mr. Matthews,

unhand that Minkus.

192
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,910
Mr. Minkus, return to your seat.

193
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:43,405
Now, then, we shall continue

reading aloud from page 1 57.

194
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:48,353
Edgar Allan Poe's
The Tell-tale Heart.

195
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,880
"They heard.

196
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,586
They suspected."

197
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,428
"They knew."

198
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,454
[Heartbeat, thunder]

199
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,363
"I couLd bear those
hypocriticaL smiLes no Longer.

200
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,702
"I feLt
that I must scream or die...

201
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,707
"and now. hark. again.

202
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,869
"Louder. Louder.

203
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,538
Louder. "

204
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,572
Mr. Matthews? Anything wrong?

205
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:27,186
&  You made me Love you &

206
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,353
&  I didn't wanna do it &

207
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,520
SHAWN: Ow.

208
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,756
&  I didn't wanna do it &

209
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:31,923
SHAWN: Ow.

210
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,457
&  You made me want you &

211
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,797
I checked outside the store.
I didn't see it anywhere.

212
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,070
-See what?
-Uh, it.

213
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,576
It?

214
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,102
It--ltaly.

215
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,446
I didn't see ltaly.
I didn't see France.

216
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:54,078
I didn't see
anybody's underpants.

217
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,588
Well, consider yourself lucky.
I just did the laundry.

218
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,591
And while
I was putting it away...

219
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:02,061
I discovered a little something
you've been hiding.

220
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,960
[Heartbeat]
What?

221
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,859
You organized your closet.

222
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:13,599
oh, yeah, yeah.
Practically cleaned itself.

223
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,701
So why don't you just
give me a hug and move along?

224
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:25,241
oK. I'll just leave you here
all by yourself.

225
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,445
Bye.

226
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,782
In the last twenty-four hours...

227
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:35,283
I almost blow off my hand
and get sucked into a Hoover.

228
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,262
You organized my closet?

229
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,265
Yeah, well, I didn't mean to.

230
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,767
Just what was I supposed to do
in this room all day?

231
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,029
Let me tell you, you have...

232
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,798
a very up-to-date collection
of video games.

233
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,567
I especially enjoyed Pong.

234
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,667
Feeny said
your parents came by school.

235
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,803
You didn't say anything,
did you?

236
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,838
Well, he was working me,
all right, but I was a stone.

237
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,784
-Cory!
-Yeah! I'm alone! Hide.

238
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,753
I fear for my life.

239
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,718
Hey. How was your day?

240
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,659
Quit pumping me! I know nothing!

241
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,961
Well, me--I had a lousy day.

242
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,194
You see, yesterday
I put about, oh...

243
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:19,103
twenty-six bills in the mailbox
outside my store, and...

244
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,902
today I found out that, uh--

245
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,205
Well, you know the rest.

246
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,644
Yeah, I heard something
along the lines...

247
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,340
of a mailbox natural disaster.

248
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:32,442
You know, the glue on those
stamps is highly flammable.

249
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,885
I heard that Shawn
may be involved...

250
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:39,051
to the extent
that, um, he did it.

251
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,617
Huh. Nowthat I did not hear.

252
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,151
SHAWN: Ah-choo!

253
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,163
-Bless you.
-Thank you.

254
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,134
You know,

when I was growing up...

255
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,329
there was a kid
in my neighborhood...

256
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,397
who was a lot like Shawn--
always getting into trouble.

257
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,737
You know,

small things at first--

258
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,074
shoplifting candy,
letting air out of tires...

259
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,512
but pretty soon,
he got kind of bored...

260
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:05,278
moved on to more serious stuff,

more dangerous.

261
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,582
Dad, Shawn's not like that.

262
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,019
I don't know. I think he is.

263
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:13,014
And if he were here right now,
I'd come down on him very hard.

264
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:15,653
SHAWN: Uh!

265
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,595
Uh, that meat loaf.

266
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,561
Because what Shawn did
was irresponsible and dumb.

267
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,230
How come you're telling me this?

268
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:29,230
Because you need to know that
if you ever do anything wrong...

269
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,742
you can always come home.

270
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,210
I don't care how bad it is...

271
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,942
it can never be as bad
as not coming home.

272
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,110
You don't have to worry
about me, Dad. I'm a come-homer.

273
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,212
Fine, because I don't care

how tight a spot you're in...

274
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:43,415
SHAWN: Ooh!

275
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,785
we're here for you.

276
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,818
-Deal?
-Deal.

277
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,960
oh, man.

278
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,164
Your dad really hurt me.

279
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,672
That stuff he said?

280
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:03,540
No. He sat on my head.

281
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,941
You know, Shawn...

282
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,377
I bet ifWe explained to my dad
how this happened...

283
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,347
he could talk to your dad,
and then--

284
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:12,112
No way.
I can't ever go home, Cory.

285
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,449
Didn't you hear
what my dad was saying?

286
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:18,583
Not all of it.
I blacked out a couple times.

287
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:19,886
All I'm saying is...

288
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,894
I think that if
both our dads worked together...

289
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:24,761
and talked it over, and my dad
explained to your dad...

290
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,493
-that you're still an oK kid--
-lt won't work, Cor.

291
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,898
Why not?

292
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,631
Because my dad will kill
your dad just to get to me.

293
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,730
Shawn, you're overreacting.

294
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:37,072
Cory, all our lives we've done
these little things...

295
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,079
but we've always stayed
on this side of the line.

296
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,808
What line?

297
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,975
The line that separates
the little bad...

298
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,711
from the big bad--

299
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,016
the line I blow up
with my cherry bomb.

300
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:52,047
Shawn, you're wrong.
Watch. I'll prove it to you.

301
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,718
Dad?

302
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,728
Dad, can you come here a second?

303
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:58,026
-No! Cory!
-Dad?

304
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,727
All right, my dad's coming.
He'll fix everything.

305
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:02,928
Shawn?

306
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,697
Shawn!

307
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,707
Hey, Hunter!

308
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,038
Shawn!

309
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:18,212
oK, he's gone.
You think he's going home?

310
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,719
I think
everything's going to be oK.

311
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,983
-Know why?
-Why?

312
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,923
Well, because that talk

you gave me up in my room--

313
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,655
well, you didn't know it,
but Shawn heard the whole thing.

314
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,289
Really?

315
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,561
Yeah, he was under my bed.

316
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,333
-Under your bed?
-Not the one I sat on?

317
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:42,739
Actually, I've been
hiding Shawn up there...

318
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,504
since yesterday afternoon.

319
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:50,474
-How long have you known?
-Since yesterday afternoon.

320
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,450
The noises
coming from your room.

321
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,612
The food you snuck upstairs.

322
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,053
It could've been a puppy.

323
00:15:56,088 --> 00:16:00,024
Cory, no one is that naive.

324
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,028
Uh, I happen to like
the puppy theory.

325
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:09,501
Mr. Feeny saw Shawn
sneak in yesterday...

326
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,526
and he phoned us to let us know.

327
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:12,697
It's a conspiracy...

328
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,672
an international
adults' hot line.

329
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:19,406
Any kid anywhere makes a move--
the phones are ringing.

330
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,380
Wait. You guys didn't tell
Shawn's parents, did you?

331
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,316
of course we did.
Cory, didn't you think...

332
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,818
how scared Shawn's parents
would be...

333
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,616
not knowing where their son was?

334
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,055
Wait, I don't get it.

335
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,059
If you guys knew all along,
why didn't you bust us?

336
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,061
Sure would've been easier on me.

337
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,120
It was killing me
trying to hide this from you.

338
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,792
Well, we knew he was safe here

with his best friend...

339
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,528
who we hoped would help him
make the right decision...

340
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:43,796
and go home.

341
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,600
Cor,

I know you really like Shawn.

342
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,231
I mean,

he's been your best bud...

343
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:51,402
since he taught you how to pick
the lock on your playpen...

344
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:54,845
but there's something I think
you should know about him.

345
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,678
You think he's a criminal.

346
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:59,378
I think he has rough edges.

347
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,976
I think
he's at a point in his life...

348
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,750
where he can go one of two ways.

349
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,279
Back on my side of the line...

350
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:09,658
or gone forever
into cherry bomb land.

351
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,528
Cory, Shawn
has always reminded your dad...

352
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:15,159
of someone he knew
when he was a kid.

353
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,669
You had a best friend
like Shawn?

354
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,639
Uh-uh. I was like Shawn.
I had a best friend like you.

355
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,403
-You did?
-Mm-hmm.

356
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,376
And when I was
about twelve years old...

357
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:29,279
I got into trouble once,
and I considered my options--

358
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,840
I could hop a train
to California.

359
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,511
I could start my life
at thirteen...

360
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,044
get a job at fourteen,
be married at fifteen...

361
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,350
have kids at sixteen.

362
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,824
I thought it was a great idea.

363
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:41,793
Sounds like a dumb idea to me.

364
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,988
oh, you think so, huh?

365
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,056
Yeah. Just because
you make one little mistake...

366
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,294
you don't want
to throw your whole life away.

367
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,634
You see, guys like you
and my best friend Richie--

368
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,139
that's the way you think.

369
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,165
Guys like me and Shawn--
we don't think like that.

370
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,700
-Did you ever go to California?
-No.

371
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,111
-Well, what happened?
-I don't know.

372
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:05,640
Somehow I ended up here
in a room with you.

373
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:09,052
Listen, Shawn's going
to get in touch with you.

374
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,318
What should I do when he does?

375
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:15,589
A kid like you--you'll know.

376
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,435
Well, I guess the room is empty.

377
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,206
What a perfect time
to set fire to my desk.

378
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:42,446
What, Cory told you I was here?
Did he rat on me?

379
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:46,948
on the contrary, Mr. Matthews
has been a true and loyal ally.

380
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,961
If anybody has betrayed
this friendship...

381
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:52,192
it was you the moment
you asked him to lie.

382
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:56,133
I would have done the same
for him.

383
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,365
Mr. Feeny, about the only thing
I'm not worried about...

384
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,896
in my life right now
is Cory and my friendship.

385
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:04,842
oh, here we go.
I knew it was here somewhere.

386
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,742
In my eagerness
to depart for the weekend...

387
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,508
I forgot to take it home.

388
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,242
What is it?

389
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:13,274
Canvas.
I often paint on the weekends.

390
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,844
Very strong material.

391
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,788
Difficult to rip.

392
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,984
Give it a try.

393
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,186
Go on.

394
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:27,791
Uh-huh.
of course, rugged as it is...

395
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,235
even the smallest snip...

396
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,465
and...

397
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:39,878
You see, Mr. Hunter...

398
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,142
once the integrity
has been breached...

399
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,584
even the strongest fabric
can unravel.

400
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,746
Even the strongest friendship.

401
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:53,623
Yeah, well, here.

Have a bandanna.

402
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,796
Aren't you going to turn me in?

403
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,823
Uh, no, I don't think I have to.

404
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,370
oh. It's not Monday?

405
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:12,867
All week long, you two ache
to get out of this classroom...

406
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,277
and here you are
in the middle of the night...

407
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,508
sneaking into it.

408
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,711
Did you bring the stuff
I asked for?

409
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,522
It's empty.

410
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,728
How about some money?

411
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,625
Can I borrow your bike?

412
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,501
Actually, I got a ride here.

413
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,631
-Who from?
-Your mom and dad.

414
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:44,837
-They're here?
-They're parked outside.

415
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,845
Forget it. I'm not going home.

416
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,847
You don't want to help me,
that's fine.

417
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,348
I'll sneak out the back.

418
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,646
Get out of my way, Cory, or--

419
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,915
or else what, you'll hit me?

420
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:58,082
Fine. Go ahead.
Wipe the floor with me.

421
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,684
-Cory, just get out of my way.
-No.

422
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:04,093
You have to go home, Shawn.
You can't run away.

423
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,894
Yes, I can!

Just get away from the door.

424
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,832
Shawn.

425
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,597
I'm not moving.

426
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:15,136
Cory, what do you want from me?

427
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:18,405
I want you to come back
on my side of the line.

428
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,071
How am I supposed to do that?

429
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,376
Just go home.

430
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,684
My parents are going
to ground me for, like, a year.

431
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,211
Well, then,

I'll see you in a year.

432
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,749
Man, I'm going to get so killed.

433
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:38,059
Yeah, well, we're only twelve.
We live again.

434
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:49,872
[Knock on door]

435
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:52,776
-What day is it?
-The 19th.

436
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,372
It's Shawn!

437
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,144
-Aah!
-Aah!

438
00:21:58,184 --> 00:21:59,583
I'm free!

439
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:03,314
-Ha!
-Ha!

440
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:04,481
&  Doo doo doo doo do &

441
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,218
&  Doo doo doo doo do &

442
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,351
A whole month! How are you?

443
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:09,622
oh, not too bad.

444
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,187
My eyes are still trying
to adjust to the light though.

445
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:13,391
Are you hungry?

446
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,957
Nah, they gave me bugs
with my potato today.

447
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,595
Whoa! I hate to interrupt
your touching reunion...

448
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,502
but there's one minute left
in triple overtime.

449
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,166
Come on, Mom,

you got to see this.

450
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,436
oK, I've got five more numbers
to enter...

451
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,841
on this spreadsheet,
and then I am done.

452
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:29,814
oh, TV. Hi.

453
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,476
Dawn, I know I've asked you out,
like, fifty times...

454
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,007
and I know you said no,
like, fifty times...

455
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,452
but you got to respect
my willingness to get shot down.

456
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:39,389
You will? Right now?
oK, where should I meet you?

457
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:40,824
-What happened?
-I had her!

458
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,851
-The game!
-Barbie's hair!

459
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,988
-I didn't save!
-Dad, what happened?

460
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,895
MOTHER: ALan. didn't you pay
the eLectric biLL?

461
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,456
ALAN: Of course I paid it.
A month ago.

462
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,958
I put it in the maiLbox
right outside my store.

463
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,733
MOTHER: On cherry bomb day?

464
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,133
